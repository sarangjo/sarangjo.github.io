This is basically an account of some of my most memorable weekend memories. Nothing else of use in the intro, skip to &lt;a href=&quot;#the-memories&quot;&gt;the main part&lt;/a&gt; if you’re actually here to read interesting content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me relatively well will know that I pretty much am the definition of “night owl”. Even when I joke about waking up early, it doesn’t go well for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: “So do you like waking up early in general?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “Yeah, you know, I’m kind of an early worm…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. It doesn’t really make sense: if I were the early worm, I’d get eaten by the early bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of staying up late, the normal “morning hours” are a thing of mystery to me. Sure, through high school I had to wake up at ungodly hours on the weekdays, but I usually didn’t wake up fully until period 3. In college, after a disastrous fall quarter freshman year where I had an 8.30AM class a 25 minute walk from my dorm, I vowed never to take a class before 10.30AM if I could manage it, and I certainly was able to, save a few annoying exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this to say, I don’t like waking up early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;strong&gt;weekend&lt;/strong&gt; mornings, those are pretty much nonexistent, because while there’s usually a good reason to be up in the mornings on weekdays, there usually isn’t any on Saturday or Sunday. Yet for some unspeakable reason, certain weekend mornings stand out in my memory like tall skyscrapers built by real estate magnates amidst a sea of slums. Perhaps it is precisely their otherworldly nature that gives them that importance, or perhaps it’s a subconscious message from my brain telling me to wake up earlier. Either way, I thought it might be nice to firmly cement these memories, and maybe even give them more meat by way of trying to remember everything that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up like a good boy by I wanna say 7.30AM. I brush my teeth, rinse my mouth, and take a quick shower, thanking all of the water bodies for giving me water to wash myself with (from Narmada River to Lake Washington). I run down the stairs, only to find my favorite Blue’s Clues cereal bowl waiting for me on the dining table filled with Cheerios, and Aai&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; getting what must be her own adult breakfast ready in the kitchen. I talk to her about whatever random thought pops into my head, as is the norm for a 2nd grader. Baba&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; joins us a few minutes later. After shoveling down a bowl full of God’s gift to children, I grab my backpack and sit on the second stair to velcro my shoes on. Once Baba is ready to go as well, I look to the little picture of Ganapati that we have next to the front door, and recite the daily morning prayer. I’m pretty proud of how well I have it memorized. Now that we’re all set, it’s time to take on the world! I jump-skip to the car, enjoying briefly the feeling of the chill Redmond air on my face. I wait impatiently in the back seat for Aai to start the car and start driving to Marathi class at the Disha office. As we drive down the main road, I plaster my face against the window, staring at the sad-looking trees passing by, long bereft of both pink spring blossoms and autumn leaves. Before I know it, we’re pulling up into the parking lot, and I excitedly look out the window for familiar cars. I spot my best friend’s car just a few spots from where we parked. I jump out the second the car pulls to a stop (but not before - Baba would get mad if I did that!). Baba and I head to the office, and I just can’t wait to get to learning Marathi with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t life wonderful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 6.45AM, Baba’s usually inaudible voice trickles through my subconscious to wake me up. I’m slow to wake, but Sanika is already up and getting fresh. How did she get up that quickly? Was she secretly awake and just waiting for Baba’s go-ahead? Whatever. I get ready right after her, not quite looking forward to the morning’s activities, but not particularly upset about them either. Of course my grandparents are awake and already having breakfast, happy just to see us before we’re on our way. I eat the almonds that Ajoba&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; offers me, our little daily routine, and down a glass of milk. Aai is a minute or two late in coming down after us, but once the four of us are ready to go, we trudge out to the Hyundai Santro. Admittedly, it’s a beautiful morning, and I can occasionally even hear the meowing (is that the right word?) of peacocks up on the hills. We drive through Panchavati and I’m once again surprised by how alive the streets are this early. We park the car at the foot of the hill after a short 2 minute drive, and commence Baba’s favorite hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversation is sporadic, but I like it that way. I walk a few paces ahead of the rest, my unreasonable pride refusing to let me walk slower even than my family. As we trek through the trees, I try to appreciate the nature around me, but all that matters to me in this moment is that I make it to the summit as fast as possible. This doesn’t quite work out, since every few minutes I have to wait for my family to catch up anyway. Frustrated, I decide to just walk at a slower pace, forcing myself to look around properly. 30 minutes from the start of our ascent, we emerge from the thickest of the foliage to the flat plateau at the top of the hill. This is my favorite part of the whole trek: you can just about see the rest of the city over the trees on all sides, and there’s a brilliantly blue pond hidden away in a quarry-like crevasse. I spot a few couples meandering around the banks, talking about whatever couples talk about. God only knows. After a quick trip around the top of the plateau, we head back down, painfully aware of how hungry we all are. The way down is faster, and correspondingly worse on our knees — or I should say, on my parents’ knees. My knees are, of course, unbreakable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hurriedly pile back into the Santro, and head over to the Joshi family’s signature breakfast place, Wadeshwar. Baba hadn’t told us this before now, but we are apparently meeting some family friends there, which made me a lot more excited for the upcoming breakfast. The expected 10-15 minute wait for the table feels more like an eternity, but when they finally call Baba’s name, we’ve already decided our orders. To be honest, mine is always the same, so I really had my order ready before we’d even arrived at the restaurant. Once the food is served and I fill my mouth with the biggest bite I can manage, I lean back in my chair, satisfied at last. Uttappas never tasted so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I groggily open my eyes as my mom knocks on my bedroom door. I make sure it is my mom, because if it’s my sister I’m going to be mad. I roughly make out what she’s saying: “It’s 11:30, we need to be at a lunch by 12!” I groan internally, fully aware that “waking up late” wouldn’t really count as an excuse for being late at a lunch scheduled for noon. For the 2000th time, I regret staying up beyond 3am the previous night for really no reason whatsoever. While I did get around 8 hours of sleep, it sure as hell doesn’t feel like it, which makes sense considering that I’d slept for less than 5 every day the preceding week. I’m grumpy, I’m tired, I’m hungry, but most of all I feel gross. I sit up and check my messages on my trusty Nokia Lumia 700, when there’s another knocking on the door. This time it is my sister, and the second I realize it is her, I shout “Calm down, उठलोय मी!” (“Calm down, I’m already up!“) Unwarranted and unnecessary, sure, but I’m annoyed. Definitely more at myself than at her, to be honest, but there you have it. It takes 20 minutes for me to get ready, my already slow pace slowed down further by my lack of interest in this lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole time, I have only one thought: if only I could sleep till 2pm and play video games all day. One day when I’m done with school and living alone, I resolve, I’ll fulfill this seemingly impossible dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up naturally, without an alarm (electronic or human). For a few seconds I’m not sure where I am, but then the unusually fluffy and warm comforter makes it clear that I’m back in the US, in particular at Atya’s&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; house. I get up and out of bed with an unusual spring in my step for this hour, and glance at my phone - it’s 7AM. Jetlag after returning from India at work. I hear the occasional bird chirping, but otherwise the lack of sounds is almost oppressive. I’m listening for the absurd music that plays when cars are reversing (take your pick from Careless Whisper, Fur Elise, or bizarrely Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer), the casual cross-society shouted conversation, and the constant buzz that means people are around — but all I hear is the occasional hybrid driving by with the faintest of sounds. I peek through the window shades, looking for a sign of life, but all I see is the quintessential Seattle spring morning: pale blue sky with the occasional clouds. After a few moments realigning my internal GPS and system clock, I go to the bathroom and get fresh. I walk downstairs more slowly than usual, once again reveling in the silence. I know I’m the only one up, since Atya likes to sleep in a bit on the weekends. The blinds are down, but the sun is bright enough to bathe the living room in a soft orange glow. I grab a bowl Honey Nut Cheerios© (some things don’t change) and moodily eat at the dining table, not really thinking about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those few moments, it feels like I’m the only one awake in the world, and the rest of the world is still in a slumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m rudely awakened by the death-knell of the default Android alarm clock. I turn over, waiting for Kavya to turn off the alarm. 5 seconds pass, then 10… Every “beep beep beep beep” (you know how it sounds) is like a knife in my heart, making it skip a beat like the end of the world is upon us. I turn back over, squinting with one eye, to realize Kavya already woke up a while ago and is finishing getting ready. I fumble with my phone, just about managing to turn off the alarm within another 10 seconds. As I turn back over, slowly being whisked away by sleep, the sweetest of temptresses, a somewhat less sweet temptress calls “Sarang! Get up, we need to leave in 2 minutes!” I can’t really ignore that, now can I. 7 minutes later, with the clock showing a delightful 5.50AM, garbed in a barely-passable-in-public outfit, we leave Stevens Court, on our way to Swedish Hospital at Cherry Hill for Kavya’s morning shift for the Prep Step program. Why the woman wants to pursue the infernal occupation of being a doctor is in this trying moment beyond me. I suppose it’s my job to be supportive and help out where I could, though, and she needed a ride, so there I am. All of this is running through my head as I get into my trusty Acura. As we drive off, the conversation steadily picks up, and the tiredness slowly fades away. At one point “Marhaba” from &lt;em&gt;Malli Malli Idi Rani Roju&lt;/em&gt; starts playing, and we get lost in trying to sing along with it. The end results of the drive, basically, are that (a) I’m much less salty about being up at such an ungodly hour, and (b) dawn had truly broken, giving the sky a beautiful glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pull into the Swedish Hospital’s parking lot, looking for a spot up on the 4th floor. I have my laptop to do some work, but I’m not quite sure where I would be able to work, so I walk with Kavya to the main hospital building. The brisk Seattle morning air firmly kicks out any last vestiges of sleepiness I may have. Kavya hastily says goodbye in the relatively empty lobby, and rushes up to her shift as I glance around for a work area to take refuge in. I spot a comfortable-looking cushioned seat, decked out with full back support (i.e. it’s right up against the wall). I settle down and pull out my laptop to get started on the latest CSE 331 project that’s due early the following week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first few minutes I’m just getting situated, having only just properly woken up. I put my headphones on, and think about what to listen to while I’m working. The answer is as clear as a message from the heavens: the last song Kavya and I listened to right before we parked. Ek Pal Ka Jeena, from &lt;em&gt;Kaho Na… Pyaar Hai&lt;/em&gt;. After 2 minutes of opening up the assignment and Eclipse, it hits me that this song might just be the single greatest song to ever be recorded by mankind, and without a moment’s hesitation I turn on the “repeat this song forever” option. I crack my knuckles. It’s go time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next 2-3 hours fly by. I can’t quite describe the feeling: on the one hand, I’m very aware that I’m in a hospital lobby, with the occasional patient walking past, sometimes accompanied by a medical professional or two; but at the same time I’m completely immersed in the project and the overpowering atmosphere of the song. I’m creating Java classes, setting up &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TreeMap&lt;/code&gt;s like a goddamn cartographer, designing the project data’s graph layout, and I feel like Neo after he realizes he’s the One. Complete clarity. Every refrain of “Ae aaye aao aaye aa” feels like an energy drink injected directly into my bloodstream. In those few hours, I finish more than I’d ever done in that small a time period. Simply put, I’ve transcended to the uppermost echelon of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transcendence must, however, eventually come to an end. After Kavya wraps up her shift, she comes down to pick me up and apologize again for making me wake up so early on a weekend. Little does she know that I’ve just had an out-of-world experience like no other. I dismiss her ridiculous apologies, finally turn off Lucky Ali’s heart-rending and seemingly never-ending voice, and put my laptop away. We head to Starbucks to grab a late breakfast, and head to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything around me has a different air to it. Even Kavya’s boring accounts of dealing with patients seem interesting in that moment&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I try to explain what my few hours were like, but I can’t quite put it into words, and just end up telling her how grateful I am that she asked me to drop her off this fateful morning. She thinks I’m being sarcastic, but I’m really not. We get back in the car, and I wonder if I’ll ever be in a mental place like that ever again. Most likely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well. Time to resume life on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t exactly know why I’m up, but somehow, I’ve transitioned from barely-asleep to barely-awake. There’s a bustle happening all around me, and seconds later I realize I’m in an Airbnb in Los Angeles, surrounded by my fellow Awaazians. I just lie there for a few minutes, listening to the semi-whispered conversation drifting down from upstairs, which is where the real action (people taking showers and getting ready) is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it. This is my last ever Awaaz competition. 4 years of arranging and practicing and rearranging and performing, leading up to this terminal moment for me to compete with my team. My other expeditions with Awaaz around the country flash in my mind’s eye — Anu negotiating earnestly with the hotel concierge at Mehfil who wasn’t happy about the number of people we were packing into the hotel rooms we’d booked; sprinting from the auditorium at Berkeley to where we were pregaming, clutching Awaaz’s first ever trophy; waiting for the last note in Nishant’s aalap at the end of Tanhayee at Awaazein, which was the cue to drop our hands. All in the past, though. Now it’s time to focus on today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open my eyes and sit up, looking around to see who was still snoozing and who’d been responsible enough to get up. I can sense a feeling of nervousness throughout the house as everyone has realized it’s finally competition day. I grab my sound check clothes and a towel, and slowly walk up the stairs, exchanging noncommittal “Good morning”s and “Sleep well?“s with whomever I passed. As my brain registers the presence and enthusiasm of the rest of my team, my mind turns to the huge task ahead of us. Somehow, even though I’m distracted by these thoughts, I arrive right as the bathroom is being vacated. I rush in before someone else can steal it, and start getting ready for sound check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look at my groggy self in the mirror, and all of my doubts and concerns from the weeks leading up to this moment fill my mind. Now I’m frantically thinking through the rest of the day, trying to remember anything I may have forgotten and making sure I have a concrete plan for the hours leading up to the performance. I repeatedly tell myself I have to be assertive and strict, to make sure we don’t waste any time and focus on the task at hand. My brushing gets more and more frantic as the gravity of the occasion starts overwhelming me. I know in my heart of hearts it’s not reasonable of me to take full responsibility for whatever happens on stage today, but I can’t bear to think about what it would be like to not place and let down my team in my final opportunity to take Awaaz to the promised land once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone knocks on the door, making sure I didn’t fall asleep in the bathroom, and I respond with a “Don’t worry, I’m just taking a 2 hour dump.” A “pch” from outside confirms that it’s Ishanie. Smiling to myself, I get in the shower and start the water. As the pitifully thin stream of shower water emerges from the showerhead, I feel my anxiety lessening a bit. A couple deep breaths later, I can organize my thoughts a bit more clearly. I know it’s going to be a tough day, and I know that there’s no knowing what’s going to happen on stage and whether we’ll place or not. But in that moment I make temporary peace with this by thinking about the fact that I’m about to share the stage with 16 of my favorite singers, all of us doing what we love the most (or at least what I love the most; who knows if they really like a cappella). Even the sputtering showerhead couldn’t shake that thought from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And isn’t that what really matters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s it. Weekend mornings: elusive yet incomparable. You’d think memories like these would inspire me to wake up early more regularly now, right? Well, I think it’s safe to say that’s not happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Apologies for the greatly varied story lengths, clearly the more recent ones are more vivid in my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S.: Once again, sorry about the ridiculous overall length too. Definitely got away from me there. A 18 minute read ain’t no joke, yikes.&lt;/p&gt;

On the one hand, I’d like to say that my 2019 has been so exciting that the last six weeks have eclipsed the last year so totally that I’ve forgotten everything that happened. On the other… that’s the farthest thing from the truth, so I might as well try to relive last year for my avid readers and paint it in as exciting a light as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a million different year reviews (and corresponding year review formats) out there, but I particularly enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@karishma.mandyam/what-happened-in-the-last-525-600-minutes-4183fd7f6cb1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Karishma’s year review&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to be a millennial about it and pretty much copy her format. Thanks Kayrish!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2018 started off with an exciting but difficult decision: committing to working at Illumio, a networking security startup in the Bay Area. When I flew down to the office for my on-site interview, there was an energy in the office that really spoke to me, and I couldn’t help but feel like Illumio was the place for me (turns out that energy was partly because lunch had just been delivered, but my point still stands). Now, just over a year on, I am totally in over my head, with a monotonically increasing laundry list of things I don’t understand, but I’m loving every minute of it. I’m finally starting to understand what all the uncles and aunties say about learning things in industry that can’t quite be taught in the classroom. And most excitingly of all, I’ve started a Game Night tradition (so far we’ve played Rocket League, Overcooked, and Smash), which is easily my biggest contribution to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Committing to Illumio in early January now meant that I could really take my foot off the pedal and enjoy my last few months at college. And boy, did I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With slow, cold February really giving me an opportunity to stop caring about school, school seemed to make sure I’d regret not caring about it. In Winter quarter 2018, I took NLP in the hopes that it would be different from my disastrous ML experience, and found those hopes dashed quicker than I could say “Backpropagation through time for recurrent neural network language models” (yes, I went back to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.uw.edu/447&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;447 website&lt;/a&gt; to look up a fun term to use for that line). So my penultimate quarter gave me my worst performance in a class at the UW  —  a fine way to round off senior year. I did learn though, in a pretty harsh way, that it’s okay to not love and be good at every part of computer science. Now I know it’s best to just stick with the trusty 1’s and 0’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March marked the culmination of probably the most impactful experience of my time at UW. This would be my very last quarter being a teaching assistant for the undergrad UW CSE courses. From barely making it as a 143 TA off the waitlist 3 years ago (to the person who opened up a spot for me that fateful day: I am eternally grateful) to TA’ing Distributed Systems in my final quarter, being a TA more than anything else made me feel like I was doing what I was meant to do in life. One of my favorite moments of my 4 years at UW was giving a substitute lecture for CSE 351 when Prof. Ceze was out of town. I don’t quite know what the next few (or many) years have in store for me, but I know that I’ll carry the giddy rush that I would get right before the start of weekly quiz sections with me forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinspire took some exciting steps this year through one of my favorite events we’ve put on: the Innovation Challenge. After attending sundry hackathons through the years, this event was more of an interdisciplinary ideathon focused on furthering Kinspire’s mission, with teams working to think of creative solutions in three categories: hardware/software, policy, and campaign. I’m proud of the work that went into the event, and even more impressed by the dedication our participants showed, coming up with fantastic project proposals that we could actually put into action. The Innovation Challenge was definitely a huge step for Kinspire and Kinspire UW, and I’m looking forward to all the great work we’ll do in 2019 (and maybe even a round 2?? Probably not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 20, 2018. Aarohi 2018. The final chapter of the club that gave me my first family at college: Awaaz. After four years of pouring my heart and soul (and vocal cords and money for flight tickets) into the University of Washington’s premier South-Asian Fusion A cappella team (once it’s hardwired into your system it never leaves you), it was finally time to pass the baton to the next generation of singing sensations unburdened by instruments. I can’t really fully go into how much Awaaz influenced my college experience, because I’m pretty sure that would overflow the ”___ minute read” algorithm at the top of this post, but in short, Awaaz gave me a priceless musical outlet (which was crucial because I barely had any other creative outlet in college), some of my closest friends for life, and an essential platform to grow as a leader. Aarohi ‘18 ended this journey perfectly with our senior song, a tour de force in and of its own right. &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/7EsSVPxaYoAZjQwhspJBs2?si=vjkJEPoERoqpJWFiWWwFpA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the month that had been on my college transcript for forever under “Graduation Month” finally arrived, I felt… nothing different, to be quite honest. The weeks leading up to graduation were more of a blur than anything else. A few highlights (besides receiving proof that I graduated) that stand out in my memory are receiving an Honorable Mention for Bob Bandes TA Award at the CSE graduation ceremony (and hearing Professor/Living Legend TOM ANDERSON talk about my achievements), and my CSE Honors research presentation. I had been doing research with the MISL Lab throughout my senior year, working on the Microfluidics project under the DNA Storage focus area. It was an immensely proud moment to deliver my final honors presentation in front of Professor/Angel in Human Form LUIS CEZE, friends, and family. Both of these memories, and the bittersweet feeling of leaving college behind, served to reinforce my love for academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. I did it. 4 years of college in the books… the questions everyone asks themselves fill my mind: Have I grown? Am I a better person than I used to be 4 years ago? Am I equipped to make decisions that will affect my life, the lives of those I love, and society at large? The time right after graduation truly is a deeply introspective one. But I decided to put those questions off until a later time and instead enjoyed an awesome ROOOADDD TRIPPPP to Portland with Sidd, Esha, and Kavya. Now that I was done with college good and proper, I could relax and enjoy an amazing visit to Oregon. Paragliding, swimming in a river, failing to flyboard, drowning my phone during aforementioned swimming in river, petting a cute cat, subsequently feeling like death because of my cat allergy, going to a shooting range for the first time — this trip had it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is tradition every year, the waning of the sunny days of summer brought with it some new beginnings. Kavya, after years of tirelessly working toward her life goal of becoming a doctor, was finally embarking on the first big step of that journey. On August 17, 2018, in front of her friends, family, and soon-to-be peers (and me I guess), Kavya officially received her white coat, joining WSU’s second ever class of world-class medical students. Listening to the Dean describe WSU’s mission of serving and dedicating one’s life to the underserved was quite surreal, because I could not believe how Kavya had found a school whose goals matched so perfectly with hers. This was, of course, a huge moment not just for her career, but also for what it meant for us in the coming months. 2018 had not been short of challenges that we had to overcome together, but this would be a huge one: Kavya diving headfirst into a life of 24/7 studying of the human body in snowy Spokane, WA, and me working all the way down in Sunnyvale, CA. But, as with every hurdle we’ve overcome, this seemingly insurmountable one has only made us stronger. Most importantly, my heart is happy because I know that Kavya is finally doing what she loves, and she’s a step closer to her destiny of making her indelible mark on this world. (It probably also helped that Southwest added a direct flight from SJC to Spokane literally a month before I moved 😊)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first few weeks on my first job in the Bay, I stayed with some extremely kind and gracious family friends, living in true luxury with delicious home-cooked Indian meals for dinner. September, however, marked an exciting new step in my “adult life” (yikes): moving into my own place. Now at last I was wholly responsible for my own well-being, away from family back in Seattle. From figuring out what to eat, to cleaning, to running adult-y errands, to establishing a routine, the onus was squarely on my shoulders to start maintaining a good lifestyle. But the challenge was a welcome one, and this more than anything has helped me become more self-reliant since then. Yay for Maggi!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weeks crept by at work, and that routine I briefly mentioned earlier started materializing, I started trying to branch out a bit and put more time into other pursuits outside of work. One of these pursuits that you could say “kicked off” in October was joining the boards of &lt;a href=&quot;https://desiacappella.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ASA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://allamericanawaaz.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;A3&lt;/a&gt;. Although I’ve left my Awaaz days behind, I found that the South-Asian A cappella community had not quite yet deserted me, and there were still a whole lot of people passionate about giving back in their own way. Both organizations are still in their infancy, since this is only the third year of A3 and second year of ASA. It’s been a fantastic few months so far, as I’ve been able to get involved with the development of the circuit as well as some technology-related projects (stay tuned for more!), and I’m incredibly excited to be a part of the circuit’s growth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work routine seems to excel at making it easy to slip into a mind-numbing rhythm without big moments like I had had in earlier parts of the year. Early on in November though, I was jerked out of my torpor with a road trip to Yosemite National Park. And by God, what a way to break away from the monotony. After the incredible vistas of Switzerland in the summer, Yosemite only served to worsen my already unquenchable thirst for nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many moments in the trip and the treks we took in the area where I was actually struck dumb by Mother Nature’s sheer grandeur. The brilliant stars at night (properly visible away from civilization, and uncapturable on my crap phone camera), the all-too-familiar evergreen foliage (miss you Washington State), and the towering monoliths of mountains  —  it was unbelievable. The trip to Yosemite reinforced my commitment to exploring more of the world around me in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December brought with it the true holiday season (although the American capitalist economy tried to convince me it started in mid-September with its (fake) “sales” and “special events”) and the prospect of flying to India for Rahul’s wedding. Although it was a short trip by my ideal standards for India trips, it was packed to the brim with action and memories. The four-day stretch leading up to the actual wedding day seemed to last a month, with all of the events and ceremonies and dance practices for the Sangeet. Most of all, it felt soooo good for the 8 cousins to be reunited with each other for the first time in half a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all the wedding was a spectacular event, and I wish the happy couple all the best!! And before you ask,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, I did &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/dec-singing.jpg&quot;&gt;sing&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, I did &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/dec-dancing.jpg&quot;&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course I stole the stage, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here is a video of both&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welp. That’s that, I suppose. Thanks for reading all the way through, I guess? Sorry about all the parentheticals btw, my thoughts are continually all over the place and that was the best way to write them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, 2018 did indeed seem to be quite a busy year. Let’s hope 2019 can hold its own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you all in “two weeks” for my next post!

My dad always pushed me when I was in middle school to just write about anything — and write about anything I did, with a strong emphasis on “anything.” Looking at my “Creative Works” folder on OneDrive, I marvel at the amazing range of uninteresting topics I managed to spew some bland words about. I wasn’t a very imaginative child, to say the least, but I suppose I tried my best at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a few (many) years later, my imagination hasn’t improved at all, but the amount of free time on my hands definitely has. And so I’m trying for the umpteenth time to get (back? No, too generous) into a regular habit of just writing. In particular, I want to try to post something on this blog once every two weeks. Sounds underwhelming, I know, but considering that my life is an endless series of writer’s block phases (at what point is something not a phase but a lifestyle?) that already sounds pretty daunting. I’ll also throw on the whole “new year, new habits” nonsense as a reason for this, even though that really is just coincidental timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important disclaimer that I want to make clear to my legions of avid readers, though, is the tagline of this blog: “Because OC is overrated.” (OC = Original Content) Almost every blog that I enjoy reading offers insights into hot-button topics plaguing today’s society, scathingly hilarious reviews and commentary of popular culture, or just such phenomenally beautiful writing that the content doesn’t even really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is going to have none of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is to projectile-vomit whatever’s on my mind when I sit down in front of my laptop, and following as cursory a review as possible, SMASH that “Post” button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please enjoy this likely failing attempt of mine to maintain some semblance of creativity in a time where a cynic would say it’s in critically short supply but a realist would say it’s in the same supply as always. Peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My 54-minute Adventure]]></title><description><![CDATA[Around 2 or so months ago, I received an innocuous 5x5 inch informational postcard in the mail.

Like Harry Potter in the first book, I was instantly enraptured. The word “scholarship” jumped out at me, and I read through it. It read January 15, 2014, and so I added it to my random pile of random college informational mail, where it lay and collected dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to January 15, 2014, at 11:03PM. I’m cleaning my desk, and that fateful postcard falls off the table. I pick it up, read the date, and my mind goes into 6th gear. I look at the clock, right as it ticks from 11:03 to 11:04PM. The night was yet young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat down, cracked my knuckles, turned on my Bollywood playlist, and started the application. There were a few hitches along the way, for sure, like 3 essays to write, but it was only another stalk of wheat in front of my unstoppable thresher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:58PM, I uploaded the last gosh darned PDF file, made sure that my name was right, and hit that Submit button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, my friends, I started and submitted a college-related application in 54 minutes. My reward? A bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios, and homework from two nights ago to catch up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life goes on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Picotech]]></title><description><![CDATA[It is 2 a.m. The soft whirring of four laptops, all on the same workbench, is the loudest sound in the room.

All four of us look at the one screen that matters, the tension in the air only exacerbated by the lack of sound. The mouse hovers over “Launch Java Application” for only a mere moment before my friend’s finger comes crashing down upon the poor mouse button. Everyone’s eyes move to his phone, those few seconds of launch to the phone feeling like ages. The screen turns black, and we all hold our breaths. But only seconds later, the black message-box of doom pops open: “Unfortunately, LightRunner has stopped working.” And just like that, the suspense breaks, with the irritated sighs of four tired, sleep-deprived, stressed high school students. We trudge the long walk of shame back to our laptops, just as the next song starts playing, ironically, “We are the Champions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s merely days until Demo Day, until salvation, until we could prove our worth in front of GeekWire Magazine and countless other co-creators. Failure after failure had continued hitting us, and as “unfortunate” as it was, a game that had been made just as a fun idea for a group project was still unfinished. Queen’s masterpiece song is greeted by silence, and the looks on everyone’s faces reflect the mood in the room: we are closer than ever to giving up. I aimlessly scroll through the code we had so tediously written, only half-heartedly looking for a potential bug in the code. I feel the waves of disappointment and helplessness coming from my comrades-in-arms, as distractions like Facebook and anything but code invade their screens. How can we hope to compare to other developers who had created so much more than a ridiculously simple mobile game? What was the point of staying up so late and stressing out so much if it was only going to fail time and time again? But in that moment of despair, I have a moment of awakening. That little part of my mind that spoke so rarely in times of helplessness loosed its rhetoric on the rest of my gloomy thoughts. The point of staying up so late, you asked? The point of failing time and time again? The point of making all those memories with friends, setting in stone those few moments of glory, so few and far in between? The more important question to ask is, what’s the point of setting and aspiring to such high goals if it isn’t difficult along the way? It’s the challenges of drawing 5 different prototypes on paper for an angling system before hard-coding the algorithm, the difficulty of handling 10 different objects in one method – and, most importantly, the unmatched toil of persevering through imminent failure that make a project really worthwhile. Without those challenges, there’s no reason for that victory at the end of the tunnel. There’s more to an endeavor like that than just being able to say you’ve finished if you didn’t have to put any effort into it – or even worse, being able to say that you gave up because it was too difficult. What makes me most proud of LightRunner and the work my friends and I did with it isn’t the fact that it’s advanced, well-made, or addicting – because it is definitely none of those things. What makes me proud of that 2000-line “marvel” is the fact that in the face of so many troubles and problems in the way, I was able to stick with it till the end, and watch it reach its fruition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inspiration, A Digression-Ridden Reflection]]></title><description><![CDATA[Inspiration, that wonderfully bright word, is one of the most important parts of our lives.

It is something that provides impetus not only for day-to-day activities (like me blogging) but also for world-changing events (like me blogging) (just kidding) (but seriously). People find inspiration from a variety of sources, all of which are an important part of their lives. Some find it in objects: say the beautiful moon in the night sky, or perhaps a particularly stunning 24-carat gold-studded vintage 1947 Berlin Staedtler periwinkle graphite color pencil that they found lying unclaimed on a wet rain-soaked street. Others might draw motivation from certain events that take place in their lives: possibly a beautiful sunrise that they witnessed as they stood atop an atoll or some such natural feature and basked in the glory of Nature in her full splendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have made clear, these sources of inspiration (SOI’s, I like to call them) are both numerous and varied. Yet each person has his/her own specific, unique seed of stimulus (I refer to it as an SOS – wait, never mind, that one’s already used). And, as a result, many people find others’ causes for encouragement (COE’s – better) to be somewhat odd, or even – if I may be so bold as to use such a scandalous word – outright stupid. While this may sound like an extreme view of my fellow human beings, if you’ll think about it, I’m sure some of you will empathize with me when I say that I cannot understand how someone can draw inspiration from a color pencil. Drawing pictures with a pencil, I understand, but drawing inspiration? I fail to comprehend. But I am confident that some bloke out there must have found aforesaid pencil in a moment of reckoning and now cherishes it with his life and creates inspired sketches and portraits of the purest genius. He, on the other hand, would find it mind-boggling that someone could be so transparently bizarre as to be inspired by an actual human being. He might think, “Is this human a pencil? Is this human gold-studded? Most important of all, is this human Vintage 1947 Berlin? Then how is it inspiring in any way?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responses to these questions are, sadly, “No.”, “No.”, and “No.” This special person that I am inspired by is not, I am ashamed to admit, not a pencil. She isn’t gold-studded, unless you count the jewelry that adorns her perennially, and she is definitely not Vintage 1947 Berlin: more like Modern 1995 Pune. And she is, the one and only, the first search result if you search her name on Google, Aboli Joshi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On days when I have nothing to do – and such days are few and far between, what with high school and all – I wonder about what I should do. Maybe play the Xbox? Or perhaps watch some video on YouTube? But writing – creative writing – is never one of the first things that come to mind. That isn’t something I can choose to do. If I want to play Xbox, I can switch the thing on, put on some headphones, and play for two to three hours on end. If I want to watch a video, I can – the only thing in my way is Internet, which isn’t that much of an obstacle. In fact, most of what I would do to pass my time is entirely a process of “Want!” to “Do!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the desire to put my thoughts down in ink – or pixels, nowadays – differs from any other of my time-passing activities in that inspiration is required before this desire to allow any stray disconnected thoughts to manifest themselves in a somewhat cohesive manner is fulfilled. My inspiration for my creative writing is almost all the time the work, thoughts, and actions of the very same Aboli Joshi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboli has been producing works of pure genius since her time in the internationally acclaimed educational institution, Saraswati Education Society’s Gurukul High School. My first experience of her work was one in the school annual, which published students’ creative work: “On the Write Track” (a pretty clever pun about the fact that the original Gurukul classrooms were housed in old railway carriages… get it? Write Track? Right Track? Track? Railway track? Oh well.) It was, I believe, a small paragraph about one of her experiences. It was short, concise, and rather badly written – because, well, she was in sixth grade. It made me laugh nevertheless. Well, more from its simplicity and scoff-worthiness than from its actual humor, but … I did laugh, and that’s all that counts. From then on out, there was no looking back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ninth grade, I decided to start taking the bus, because, heck, why not? It just so happened that that annoying, short, loud, bespectacled, bossy prefect who no one listened to was on the same bus as I was. To keep up my reputation of making sure every girl in the school hated me, I tried talking to her so as to piss her off. Turns out she was better at it than I was, much better, and she effortlessly kept up her reputation of being irritating and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know I’m being mean here, but just wait for a bit and I’ll get to the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first week or two, it wasn’t so bad, and we could all have a cohesive conversation – and by conversation I mean Aboli saying 4-5 sentences and one of the rest of us slipping in maybe a sentence, most often just a word or two. And then it would be followed up by another 15 minutes or so of Aboliness (“Aboliness.” Noun: The quality of speaking rapidly without paying attention to other people’s responses.) It was quite amusing for a large portion of the year, because the topics we “talked” about were so random and unrelated to anything that listening to Aboli’s spin-offs was often the highlight of my day. And, for the first time ever, I actually askedto take the bus instead of going by car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 9th grade, our fates entwined once more… Okay, that sounds weird. What I mean is that we ran into each other again and were forced to put aside our MANY differences and work together. For that year, it was the 9th and 10th grades’ job to create a script for the annual concert. For some reason, both she and I were on the writers’ board. As was the norm, Aboli took – or should I say stole – the reins of the writing process, and she spearheaded the effort to make it interesting and funny: thus came the idea of a spoof of the Ramayana and the Trojan War. I was a bit taken aback at her writing skills, to be honest. I mean, irritating, sure. Annoying, sure. Intolerable, sure. But good at writing? This was unprecedented. But I rolled with it and spouted script of the purest genius while she floundered around looking for some good content. (I’m just kidding, I didn’t contribute anything to the process at all) When we were finished, the entire script looked great, and Aboli’s contribution made it the perfect send-off for their batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There on out, there was no looking back. We overcame the initial disgust that we had for eachother (I got cooties shots that year, I believe), and a great friendship was born. Sadly, just as this great partnership in crime was about to bloom, I moved to the US, leaving her in tears. Regardless of the distance between us, I firmly hold true to my belief that Aboli, since I’ve gotten to know her amazing, unparalleled genius, has inspired me in more ways than I can write down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her writing is some of the most beautiful, poetic, and metaphoric I have ever witnessed. Aside from their eloquence and elegance, what she writes has an amazing second layer of meaning that is so relatable and believable that it blows my mind away every time. From her innocuous but cute poem about History, back in 2008, to her moving response to the horrendous Delhi gang rape crime, Aboli’s writing inspires me to write my own again and again. Every time I see an update on Facebook, or on my Blogger, I instantly read what she’s written, marvel at her genius, and then get an idea for a possible piece of prose or poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While inspiration may come in various forms, mine has come from that one bubbly, annoying, condescending, loud, bespectacled girl. She never ceases to amaze me. I feel unquestionably honored and lucky beyond words to have a friend such as her. And while another might wish she was a 24-carat gold-studded Vintage 1947 Berlin Staedtler periwinkle graphite color pencil, I guess I can live with what she is right now.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Key is Balance]]></title><description><![CDATA[Problems only arise when you give too much importance to what they arise from.

If you decide to mold your entire life only off of your social life, then any mishap - or, as you say, ‘detour in the opp. direction’ - will cause a major setback in my entire life. Balancing out priorities, or things we give importance to, always helps. Most teenage girls lay importance only on two things - social life, and school. Unconsciously, they assign overwhelming importance to one on their own, and an external force (homework, teachers, or exams, for example) stresses the importance of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to solving this problem is adding another factor in our life. You told me you play basketball, correct? There’s your third factor. Music could be another, or drawing. Or even composing a poem about how wonderful your friend is. Things like those help immensely in general. But you must remember to lay the correct amount of importance (and, consequentially, stress) on it. Being too carefree about something - breaking regular routine, not going to classes (if any) - isn’t help, and neither is getting too worked up about even the simplest of things. The key, as I see it, is balance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Glasses]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dedicated to all those lucky ones who can relate to this poem.

&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to all those lucky ones who can relate to this poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just so happens, that once in a while,&lt;br&gt;
Everything you see looks double,&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes it’s the faraway objects you can’t make out,&lt;br&gt;
And sometimes it’s the close ones that are the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You obviously start to wonder why,&lt;br&gt;
All you see has just gone blurry,&lt;br&gt;
And when you can’t even see your beloved TV characters’ faces,&lt;br&gt;
It’s then when you start to worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible, you might think,&lt;br&gt;
That the 3D effect is getting to your mind,&lt;br&gt;
But then you realize, it’s then you figure out,&lt;br&gt;
It’s then that you finally find;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it’s your eyes that are the problem,&lt;br&gt;
When you think the world’s gone insane,&lt;br&gt;
It’s just that your optic nerves&lt;br&gt;
Just aren’t getting those images proper to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grudgingly, you go to the eye-doctor’s place&lt;br&gt;
To meet him, and try to read off those ever-shrinking letters&lt;br&gt;
He looks at you, gives that sad smile, and says,&lt;br&gt;
“Sorry, pal. It’s all for the better!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You walk out of there, with those geeky glasses,&lt;br&gt;
Yet the world looks crystal clear,&lt;br&gt;
While earlier, you couldn’t tell a tree from a car,&lt;br&gt;
You can tell when your date’s finally here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when you look around,&lt;br&gt;
And things don’t seem to make any sense,&lt;br&gt;
Just reflect about that gift from God, &lt;br&gt;
That retina, iris, and optic lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think that it’s the world that’s wrong&lt;br&gt;
Think a while; let your mind run free,&lt;br&gt;
The problem’s not in what you’re looking at,&lt;br&gt;
It lies in how you see.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Animation]]></title><description><![CDATA[When one hears the word “animation”, what is the first thing people think about?

Mostly games, cartoons, and videos. But in reality, animation is a highly advanced concept, regarding the motion of (seemingly) inanimate objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first animation was a “crude” one. It was involved with the usage of a flip-book. On each page of the book was a character in one pose, changing minutely with every page. So, when the flipbook is flipped, the character apparently “moves” from one pose to the other, giving the impression of motion of the character. This is the basis for the advanced animation which we see all around us today. The only difference is that instead of a flipbook, we have a binary matrix; and instead of our hand flipping the book, we have a superfast computer shuffling through the images and light-speed. This is even more effective (obviously) because of two reasons. One is that the images which are stored are copies of the previous, only modified subtly. The other is that the speed gives an even smoother experience. This concept of composing a smooth moving image from many different “frames” is based on a scientific principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our eyes have a property called the persistence of vision. In accordance with this, our eyes take 1/24th of a second to capture an image on the retina and send it to the brain where it is processed. This means that in a second, our eyes can send 24 images to the brain. Now, if two images are sent to the eye within 1/24th of a second, the second image is like a delay and when the brain processes it, it is like a smooth moving object. This is an extremely powerful concept, which is put to full use in animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animation is useful in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it is an amazing source of entertainment for more than 50% of the world’s population. It gives an outstanding feeling of actually being in that virtual world – not only video, but also interactive gaming has been taken to higher and higher levels with newer and more advanced animation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it is a great tool for teaching and introducing programming to children (or college students, for that matter). The attractiveness and addicting nature of animation is a very fun way to teach the excellent concept of programming. The fun nature of animation is an excellent incentive for students to enthusiastically take part and experiment new vistas of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, there are many animation software applications present – Alice and Scratch to name two elementary applications. They have made using and working on animation very easy-to-understand and user-friendly, so as to make more and more people aware of this great tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So animation is an awesome concept of today’s world. It can be used in many ways, as I showed above. I hope that I have been able to drive through the great use and implementations of this wonderful tool.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Sound Belief]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently, in school, in my Honors class, we were asked to write an essay on the general topic “This I Believe”.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, in school, in my Honors class, we were asked to write an essay on the general topic “This I Believe”. Actually, “This I Believe” is a program which used to play on the public channel NPR. Basically, it was a 350-500 word assignment, wherein we had to write about what we, as a person, believed in. It was meant to be strictly personal, and was not a medium of sermonizing. We were asked to use “I” instead of “We” or “Them”. Here is the actual prompt: &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisibelieve.org/guidelines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://thisibelieve.org/guidelines/&lt;/a&gt; Also, I recorded myself reading out my essay, which link is also included before the essay itself. My advice is, open the audio file in a different tab, and as you’re listening, read the essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my essay turned out pretty good. I thought it would be nice as my next blog post, because now that I look at it, my blog is pretty skimpy: one poem and two posts by a hyper kid - not exactly what you’d call “great”. Anyway, here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my faults, my younger sister says, is my habit of humming every moment of the day. When she’s doing her homework, or watching TV, she just can’t bear it when I hum a random tune that she’s never heard before. And sometimes, I understand her pain. But, no matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop humming those tunes – it happens subconsciously. Sometimes, I start strumming on an imaginary guitar (when, in fact, I don’t know how to play guitar). I don’t consider this as a problem: I believe it’s a blessing. I find myself doing things better with music around me. The redoubtable George Bernard Shaw says, “Hell is full of musical amateurs.” Music is such an intrinsic part of me that it keeps me company in almost everything I do.
You must have guessed what the topic of my essay is: I believe in the power of music. I believe that music is a gift that I must cherish and treat as a source of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents have both been musicians – my father started playing the violin when he was 12, and my mother began learning Indian classical music at 11. So, I have been exposed to all types of music. My parents tell me that I usually went to bed with piano tunes of Elton John’s songs playing in the background. Music helped shape my personality and how I think. Music has always seemed the best way of expressing my emotions. The true meaning of a song goes beyond the straightforward façade of its lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes – when I’m feeling low or when I am in a reminiscent mood – I watch videos of my early childhood. In one video my mother asks me to sing a song. Leaping up enthusiastically, I sing like a typical five-year-old would. Once it’s done, I immediately start another song, oblivious to the audience’s discomfort. They bear with me until I finish the second song, and just when my mom says – “Okay, good job! Sit down.” – I go on to start one more! You can see my cousin sister laughing openly, and a few others smiling away – the whole situation is just hilarious. But it’s a sweet memory nevertheless. It shows how music has influenced me right from my early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am not the only one who loves and cherishes music. It has a place in everyone’s heart. Music is one of the most beautiful aspects of human life. The rhythm, the tune, and the innumerable musical instruments – all of these symbolize the human passion for music. No wonder most religious hymns are in musical form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky to be able to understand (to a small extent) and sing (to a smaller extent) a variety of music. Just listening to a song can lift my mood – it shows me what life is really all about. As the famous author, Aldous Huxley, states: “After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A New Dimension]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently, I got an interesting new gaming device called the Nintendo 3DS.

It is the next in Nintendo’s handheld gaming line, the Nintendo DS. The main features are the two screens, one wide and the other touch, and other control buttons. This is not exactly new. But, one feature which makes the 3DS a class apart from other devices lies in the name itself – it has 3D graphics (on the widescreen) … without the need for glasses! I thought about how this was possible – and so delved into the history of 3D Graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D graphics are basically an artificially generated 2D image to trick the brain into thinking that that image is indeed 3D. The original 3D image was a red-green shifted image. This meant that the image was composed of two images – the same figure, but differently positioned. One was red in colour, and the other was green. Now, the user was required to wear special glasses, where one lens was red and the other green. The idea behind this was that in one lens, say red for example, would absorb the red image and only transmit the green image. Meanwhile, the other green lens would absorb the green image and only transmit the red. So, each eye would get two differently-positioned images of the same “object”. This is how our eyes detect 3D in our regular world – and this is how it feels that that red-green (RG) image is indeed 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, however, was not comfortable, and would cause eye-strain. So, safer, more comfortable polarized glasses were invented. These were based on the more advanced concept of photon polarity – but in basics, they had the same principles as the RG glasses. Different polarity photons were reflected by the polarization filters in the glasses, and only similarly polarized photons would pass. And, since both the eyes had different filters, they would receive differently positioned superimposed images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these 3D graphics images were solely based on the following concept. When each eye received slightly “shifted” images of the same object, together the eyes would interpret it as 3-Dimensional. The methods mentioned above involve the need for special glasses, for the image is a shifted image. But the researchers at Nintendo thought of a different way around it. If the screen itself was somehow able to give each eye a different image, then there would be no need for those “geeky” glasses! The manufacturing unit ingeniously came up with the 3DS, having an upper widescreen showing crystal clear 3D images, without glasses. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper LCD screen has another “barrier” on top of it. Called the parallax barrier, it has accurately placed micro mirrors and lenses positioned so that the actual image seen on the screen would be “split” into two, and each slightly different image would be sent to the eye! Unfortunately, this parallax barrier required extremely delicate materials and accurate production. So, this was easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem the producers faced was that the two images portrayed with the help of the Parallax Barrier could be interpreted by the eye as 3D only at a certain angle (distance didn’t matter that much). But this was easily adapted as they included a “3D Slider”, which enabled the user to manually adjust the depth of the images, or turn in to pure 2D images. This was a quite interesting technology in itself – but better stuff was yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3DS comes with two cameras – outer and inner facing. The inner facing is a simple 2 Megapixel lens. But the outer camera is far more intriguing and interesting. This is the 3DS 3D Camera. It has two lenses, with which it captures two images. These are processed and then placed appropriately so that they appear 3D. This alone was a novelty in the 3D industry (so to speak) and caused wonders in their sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question which arose (for me) was whether this could be used in theatres, or TVs. The main problem with this is that that technology is too expensive at such a high scale. Another thing is the problem about the “sweet spot” for 3D. If there is a wide audience, even for the 3DS, the images would appear blurred. In a theatre, you can only imagine how horrible it would look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the world today is full to the brim with innovative minds, which are ever ready to come up with great ideas – and I feel, this is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fiction]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some years ago when I was in my prime, I was basking in a new-found glory, Being famous and popular all around, I was the subject of every…]]></description><link>https://sarangjo.github.io/poetry/fiction/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sarangjo.github.io/poetry/fiction/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some years ago when I was in my prime,&lt;br&gt;
I was basking in a new-found glory,&lt;br&gt;
Being famous and popular all around,&lt;br&gt;
I was the subject of every story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one day, I took a walk&lt;br&gt;
To escape my hectic fame,&lt;br&gt;
And, sitting down, thinking about quiet,&lt;br&gt;
Waited patiently for the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, in the glen where I was seated,&lt;br&gt;
I heard a whooshing sound,&lt;br&gt;
And then an incident occurred,&lt;br&gt;
That left, on my mind, an impact profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heroes, Carter and Sadie Kane&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Intruded upon my premises –&lt;br&gt;
From their facial expression&lt;br&gt;
It seemed they had left behind Horus and Isis&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seemingly looked handsome,&lt;br&gt;
For Sadie began to giggle and laugh,&lt;br&gt;
Carter, giving her a stern look, said:&lt;br&gt;
“Sir, I want your autograph.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my expression turned from excited to astonished,&lt;br&gt;
Watching it must have been fun,&lt;br&gt;
But before I could get a single word through,&lt;br&gt;
There arrived on the spot – Percy Jackson&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dressed in full Greek battle armour&lt;br&gt;
With his sword and shield at the ready,&lt;br&gt;
Reading his determined expression,&lt;br&gt;
It was hard to imagine him, in war, unsteady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he said, “Oh foolish Kane siblings,&lt;br&gt;
I have Annabeth&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by my side.”&lt;br&gt;
As if by magic, there she appeared and said:&lt;br&gt;
“We’ll kill you with my knife and his Riptide&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Sadie opened her mouth,&lt;br&gt;
On the demigods, some insult to confer,&lt;br&gt;
Some more visitors descended from the skies&lt;br&gt;
Saphira&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-7&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Eragon&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and his sword Brisingr&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-8&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;br&gt;
Eragon was clad in complete Alagaesia&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-9&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; outfit,&lt;br&gt;
Brisingr glistened in the mini-parade,&lt;br&gt;
Saphira was looking as ferocious as ever,&lt;br&gt;
Looking at them, it was hard not to feel afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eragon seemed to be frustrated,&lt;br&gt;
And said: “Your aspirations are all amiss.&lt;br&gt;
The autograph will only be mine,&lt;br&gt;
I will blast you with the teachings of Oromis&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-10&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned by these amazing heroes&lt;br&gt;
Among the Dobermans, I felt like a cocker spaniel,&lt;br&gt;
But somehow, I felt there was someone missing,&lt;br&gt;
Sure enough – now came Bartimaeus&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-12&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Nathaniel&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-11&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel, rather John Mandrake,&lt;br&gt;
Was in a suit that looked rather funny,&lt;br&gt;
And Bartimaeus, the wily djinn he was,&lt;br&gt;
Presented himself in the form of Ptolemy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-13&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magician of amazing punctuality&lt;br&gt;
Had drawn for Bartimaeus a pentacle&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-14&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
And said with unfaltering superiority:&lt;br&gt;
“I’ll turn you all to pickle!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bartimaeus sniggered quietly&lt;br&gt;
But didn’t dare make a noise,&lt;br&gt;
And I think the others were quiet because&lt;br&gt;
They tried to maintain a ‘laugh-less’ poise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked to me as if Eragon,&lt;br&gt;
Having had enough of the crazy boy,&lt;br&gt;
Was about to cast a deadly magic;&lt;br&gt;
But couldn’t start his ploy:&lt;br&gt;
For now the newest guest arrival&lt;br&gt;
Was the mastermind Artemis Fowl&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-15&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
Then, as he noticed the crowd gathered for me,&lt;br&gt;
His smirk turned into a growl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artemis was the only one,&lt;br&gt;
Who spoke for Mandrake, a retort:&lt;br&gt;
“It will be me who gets the autograph first –&lt;br&gt;
For who can beat my mastermind and Holly Short&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-16&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer for this rhetoric,&lt;br&gt;
Could have been Annabeth Chase,&lt;br&gt;
But there Apparated&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-18&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Harry Potter&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-17&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
Calmly, he replied to Fowl’s phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please don’t be so confident,&lt;br&gt;
You and the fairy are no match for me,&lt;br&gt;
Now that I have defeated Voldemort&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-20&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
No one can stop me and Ginny&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-19&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if in response to his loving call,&lt;br&gt;
Ginny Weasley appeared on the scene,&lt;br&gt;
But the contest for my overly famous autograph,&lt;br&gt;
Now made her a jealous teen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone, this was the last straw –&lt;br&gt;
The rising tempers were oh! So plain,&lt;br&gt;
When another visitor intruded our gathering –&lt;br&gt;
The shabbily dressed Saddam Hussein&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-21&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my fantasy fiction friends,&lt;br&gt;
Looked in awe at this non-fiction character,&lt;br&gt;
But alas! As they would realize later,&lt;br&gt;
They had forgotten the modern technology factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, without caring to speak a word,&lt;br&gt;
He took out his favourite device,&lt;br&gt;
And, with a simple flick of the arm,&lt;br&gt;
The bomb completed my heroes’ demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, though I hadn’t realized it then,&lt;br&gt;
The bomb had not affected me at all,&lt;br&gt;
But I was afraid to speak up,&lt;br&gt;
In front of Hussein so strong and tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrorist then gave me a notebook,&lt;br&gt;
Right after they had all been blasted away,&lt;br&gt;
I took it, signed, and asked myself:&lt;br&gt;
“What has fiction come to today?”&lt;/p&gt;

I went to both of them, and it was an amazing experience for me – I had never seen or heard anything like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, 1 May 2010, I had gone to Nivu’s house. At 6:25 p.m., we left her house for Forest Ridge school with her parents. Nikita was in the choir and had been in the school since morning. We went in their Land Rover and I enjoyed watching the GPS. We went to Somerset, where the school was. It was on a hill, and the view was simply outrageously beautiful. We could see the whole of Seattle and Bellevue, with Downtown and the Space Needle in the evening light. The school was awesome as well, with newly refurbished buildings and campus. We went to the Sacred Heart Chapel, where the program was. That day, only the Forest Ridge School Choir was singing. A world-famous composer and conductor, Mr Stephen Hatfield was going to conduct the choir. The performance was fantastic! They sang songs from all over the world – Celtic, Slovak, Ukrainian, and many more. Mr Hatfield was the pick of the show – he was just so crazy and hyperactive. He composed most of the songs in 5 to 6 pieces and it was very well coordinated. At the end, Mr Stephen Hatfield collapsed on the floor and everyone in the audience stood up and laughed and clapped riotously for the choir. We had some cookies too, after the choir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, all 6 of us – Aai, Baba, Ajji, Ajoba, Sanika, and I – were going to see the choir perform. This time, 6 more schools were coming with their choirs to perform and Forest Ridge was only going to sing one or two songs. Mr Hatfield was there the day as well, and he had worked with the individual choirs the whole day long. The Forest Ridge Choir sang three of the same songs as the night before. The other schools came up and staged their performances with great vigor, and the crowd responded with applause of equal, if not greater, vigor. Finally, all the students came together to sing two mass items. Even though there were 180 or so students, the binge was a great success, and, like the previous day, the spectators gave a standing ovation to the singers, and they bowed – once – twice – to the great smattering of applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the whole program to the fullest and hope that I will get to see (and hear) it once more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Companion]]></title><description><![CDATA[One day I was walking through A meadow of yellow-green I saw a tiny something That barely could be seen.

A meadow of yellow-green&lt;br&gt;
I saw a tiny something&lt;br&gt;
That barely could be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My curiosity took over&lt;br&gt;
And I went there to see&lt;br&gt;
A young little seed&lt;br&gt;
That captivated me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked it up and took it home&lt;br&gt;
And planted it nearby&lt;br&gt;
Everyday I watered it&lt;br&gt;
And waited for it to grow high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this happened many years ago&lt;br&gt;
I can barely remember the view&lt;br&gt;
But I still recall that everyday&lt;br&gt;
I gave it water anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very unimportant thing to me&lt;br&gt;
Just a simple passing whim&lt;br&gt;
But now, as I see what it has become&lt;br&gt;
I am sure it was a gift from Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little seed which I picked up&lt;br&gt;
Has now become a tree&lt;br&gt;
That now can fend for itself&lt;br&gt;
And bears fruit for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is not all; not by a long way,&lt;br&gt;
It has been with me the whole way through&lt;br&gt;
I sat under its shade and played in its branches&lt;br&gt;
It comforted me when I was blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I understand its importance&lt;br&gt;
But alas! I have found out too late&lt;br&gt;
For my dear companion since childhood&lt;br&gt;
Has met its cruel fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it was in my land&lt;br&gt;
A woodcutter had chopped it down&lt;br&gt;
Just the stump was left;&lt;br&gt;
Only it was left brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was left speechless&lt;br&gt;
I couldn’t at all believe this&lt;br&gt;
And I realized finally&lt;br&gt;
What greatness I would miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember coming home&lt;br&gt;
And seeing it stand tall and lean&lt;br&gt;
Now my heart fills with sadness;&lt;br&gt;
My companion can barely be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cricket]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cricket is a team game – everyone needs to play his part, to contribute to the team’s victory.

And, to handle the team, there is a Captain. Co-ordinating the players, setting the field, deciding who will play – these are just some of the endless jobs on his list. The performance of the team reflects how well he handles it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that the best captain in modern cricket was Mahendra Singh Dhoni, in the initial few months of his captaincy. A bright youngster at the time, Dhoni had showed promise, with a few 50+ knocks. As a test, the Board put him up as the captain, to see how his leadership was. And yet, he led the Indian team to success. Time and time again, he not only captained well, but played his game well – wicketkeeper as well as batsman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch his games, when India is fielding, you will notice Dhoni always cheering his team, helping them play well. Patiently, he directs the fielders, never getting angry himself. He exhibits all the good qualities of a leader – good leadership, calmness, and a great presence of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I hope that this will help him lead India to a World Cup! Bleed Blue!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Caught in the Rain]]></title><description><![CDATA[It was a sunny afternoon, No sign of wind or rains, I was leaving after a Math class, My mind was full of lines and planes.

No sign of wind or rains,&lt;br&gt;
I was leaving after a Math class,&lt;br&gt;
My mind was full of lines and planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My royal vehicle for today&lt;br&gt;
Was a humble two-wheeled bicycle,&lt;br&gt;
The poor thing’s seat was 2 years old,&lt;br&gt;
It made my bottom tickle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now as I left the class building,&lt;br&gt;
And mounted my mode of transport,&lt;br&gt;
The skies began to darken;&lt;br&gt;
It seemed the Gods had something to sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the ominous signs,&lt;br&gt;
And hoisting up my pack,&lt;br&gt;
I started pedaling vigorously,&lt;br&gt;
Even as stray drops began to fall on my back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drizzle turned into downpour&lt;br&gt;
Not at all showing any mercy,&lt;br&gt;
I cycled on, getting wetter and wetter,&lt;br&gt;
For there was no jacket with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around half an hour from home,&lt;br&gt;
I felt something give way,&lt;br&gt;
So, with an irritated moan,&lt;br&gt;
I got down to see what had gone astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tires was at fault,&lt;br&gt;
Once it had been round and fat,&lt;br&gt;
But this time it betrayed its sodden master,&lt;br&gt;
And had now become quite flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cursed in anger and irritation,&lt;br&gt;
But that did next to nothing,&lt;br&gt;
The punctured tire was an indication,&lt;br&gt;
That I had to go home walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking was rather fun for me,&lt;br&gt;
Actually, a marvelous exercise,&lt;br&gt;
But, oh, doing it was next to hell —&lt;br&gt;
In a precipitation of such size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was my body getting wet,&lt;br&gt;
As from the rain I fled,&lt;br&gt;
But also my spirit’s color inside,&lt;br&gt;
Was turning from yellow to red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed that Fate himself today,&lt;br&gt;
Was, with me displeased,&lt;br&gt;
For barely five long minutes later,&lt;br&gt;
Into another calamity I was seized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right in front of my very own eyes&lt;br&gt;
An accident then happened,&lt;br&gt;
A bus stopped unintentionally in the middle of the road,&lt;br&gt;
Exactly on the edge of the bend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now other pressing matters&lt;br&gt;
Presented themselves first,&lt;br&gt;
An innocent scooter cruising along&lt;br&gt;
Crashed into the bus headfirst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hoped that that was all for now,&lt;br&gt;
And I could move along quickly,&lt;br&gt;
But, “No,” Fate seemed to say,&lt;br&gt;
“You won’t get away so easy!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A navy-green open air jeep&lt;br&gt;
Behind the unlucky bike&lt;br&gt;
Ploughed straight into the bus’s façade,&lt;br&gt;
Changing forever my ebbing psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accident of colossal magnitude&lt;br&gt;
Induced a great traffic jam,&lt;br&gt;
From the speed of an enthusiastic turtle,&lt;br&gt;
I now moved like a lazy ram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to stall for minutes on end,&lt;br&gt;
Receiving glares from passers-by,&lt;br&gt;
Who quickly passed me with umbrellas and raincoats;&lt;br&gt;
In my wet state, my envy was on high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patch of road that I covered usually&lt;br&gt;
In around 10 minutes in normal conditions ,&lt;br&gt;
Now gave me 45 soaked minutes,&lt;br&gt;
Of honks and noxious emissions.&lt;br&gt;
At long last I escaped that bane&lt;br&gt;
Of Modern western technology,&lt;br&gt;
And, leaving behind a tangled mess of cars,&lt;br&gt;
I was finally set free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hoped, with my fingers crossed,&lt;br&gt;
That my walking odyssey was about to end,&lt;br&gt;
But no, sadly, it was not to be –&lt;br&gt;
For it was against Fate I had myself to defend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a mere 20 metres to traverse,&lt;br&gt;
My forlorn cycle once more refused to budge,&lt;br&gt;
As, even with one tire gone flat out,&lt;br&gt;
It became stuck in the muddy sludge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my anger took full control,&lt;br&gt;
Swearing, I kicked the cycle and left it there,&lt;br&gt;
And sprinted on regardless of my drenched state,&lt;br&gt;
Looking forward to peace and calmness rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was six o’clock when I reached –&lt;br&gt;
The class had ended by four,&lt;br&gt;
And, not caring to narrate my story,&lt;br&gt;
I rested my body sore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a very good rest then,&lt;br&gt;
I woke up fully renewed,&lt;br&gt;
To find my whole family,&lt;br&gt;
Watching some soap show feud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out after some inquiry,&lt;br&gt;
That the clouds had stopped their crying din,&lt;br&gt;
In fact it seemed that the downpour ceased&lt;br&gt;
The moment I stepped within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this, for me, was a solid fact,&lt;br&gt;
That Fate in all his force,&lt;br&gt;
Had focused verily on me&lt;br&gt;
The moment I began my homeward course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after waking up sniffing from a cold,&lt;br&gt;
I unpacked the bag I had taken to class,&lt;br&gt;
And, rummaging inside with some nonchalance,&lt;br&gt;
Found a jacket, an umbrella, and a bus pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Oh life, so cruel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Trip to Las Vegas]]></title><description><![CDATA[My family and I were very excited on going to the city of Las Vegas.

We packed up and waited for the arrival of Sanjay kaka. We loaded our baggage into the Range Rover and climbed on. We arrived in due time and did the needful at the airport. To our surprise, the flight was already boarding. We hurriedly got into the line and handed over our tickets to the attendant who processed them and allowed us to pass. I was looking forward to sitting in the plane because we had booked First Class Tickets. The area around the seats was very spacious and I sat with Sanika. I played Nintendo DS™ for some time, and then we played Rush Hour. I also read Agatha Christie. We reached Las Vegas airport at around 11:30 p.m. We picked up our baggage and waited in the taxi line. The line was almost never-ending and finally after about 20 minutes, we found a taxi for ourselves and rode to our 4-star hotel, Monte Carlo. At 12:10, we checked in and rushed to our room, 30-126, and fell into a deep sleep. The next morning we got a wake up call from a family we were going to meet: the Bhargava family. We got ready and headed down to the hotel food court where we saw them. Their names were Sandeep Uncle, Dimple Aunty, Rohan, and Sonal. They had already taken their breakfast and we introduced each other. Then we got our breakfast (mine was scrambled eggs and pancakes from McDonald’s) and sat down to devour it all. We got to know each other better, though Sanika was a bit cranky. We then went to the Bellagio, where there was a beautiful ceiling and a marvelous indoor garden and an amazing chocolate fountain. We all had ice cream and then went back outside to have lunch. While we were going outside, we noticed musical fountain which were put up by the Bellagio staff. It was so beautiful and it swayed to and fro. We looked around for a good Indian place to eat. We headed to a place called Planet Hollywood and inquired about an Indian restaurant. The said there was one after the Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Showroom. As we exited the place, my dad noticed a gigantic crystal sphere on the ceiling. After I looked more intently, I noticed that it was made up of hundreds of suspended crystals. Then, near the entrance doors, we found a wall consisting of “Welcome” in many languages. I scanned it for the Marathi version and found what I was looking. It said, “Swagat Aahe”. As we walked, I could tell that poor Rohan was feeling downright exhausted. So I tried to cheer him up, which surely did work. As we walked past the Motorcycle Showroom, we saw a huge motorcycle crashing out of the showroom. Finally, we saw the place, called “Tamba”. We had a stomach-filling lunch and then headed to Monte Carlo. There, the adults played a gambling game and the kids played Zooreka®. After that, there was a big jumble-up on who would play what. Rohan and Sanika were not ready to co-operate, though Sonal and I were ready to play together. Because of the toddlers, we couldn’t play anything. Then, we went to the M.C. Food Court and ordered our snack. After that, at around 6:30, we went to the Lance Burton Theatre for the Lance Burton Magic Show. It was spectacular and the amazing thing was that I was called on stage and was the day’s volunteer!!!! First Mr. Burton extracted coins from my nose, mouth, ears, armpits, sleeves, and more. Then, he said, “Thanks for co-operating so well. As a present, I’ll give you my very own Corvett car!!” He told me to sit in the car, and then told me to wave and smile. Then suddenly there was a bang and the car, Mr. Burton, and I disappeared! Then a nice lady called Karen called me and took me out of the car. We walked into the prop room, and she asked me my name and spelling to put on the screen. Then we went through a door which exited in the middle row. Then suddenly, the narrator told everybody to look at the chandelier. The chandelier began to descend and on the chandelier was Lance Burton!! Then he took my hand and led me to the stage where I bowed and then returned to my seat. After the show, we went to the Lance Burton Magic Shop and bought magic items. We went to the Food Court again and had dinner. At the court, people were shooting glances at me. I was famous!!  After dinner, we went to the Bellagio Musical Water Fountain Show. It was just amazing!!! I was flabbergasted by the precision of the synchronization of the music and water fountain. We saw to shows and then headed back to Monte Carlo. There I told them the disappearing trick which was done on the car. I wanted to play some more, but I was also tired and went to sleep. The next morning, Sunday, we went for breakfast with the Bhargavas. We then went up to the hotel room for some time to get ready, and then got into the Dodge™ Explorer® car and went to Hoover Dam and the artificially made Lake Mead. It was stupendous and the Hoover Dam was gigantic. We saw a video on how it was built and then we left Hoover Dam. It took us around half an hour to get back to Monte Carlo and upon reaching, we had lunch and relaxed. We played together and in the evening, the adults went to the casino. We played Zooreka and DS again, and then we went to Treasure Island for dinner. I had an episode of static shock and Rohan joked around by constantly poking at me. Then we went for Mystére by Cirque Du Soleil. It was just fantastic. The way the artists performed was just amazing. On the way back, that was all we talked about. Then, upon reaching Monte Carlo, we visited the Bhargavas, took some last-minute pictures, and then said bye-bye to them. We slept and the next morning, they were gone. We-Baba, Sanika, and me- went to the wave pool and had a lot of fun. Then we went upstairs got ready and went into the lobby to wait for my dad’s friend called Nilesh Kaka. We met him and went to his house. There we met his wife too. He gave me Harry Potter despite the disapproval of my parents. We went to the Venitian and had fun there. I ate a burrito. After that we went to the airport and the marvelous trip to Las Vegas was over!!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
