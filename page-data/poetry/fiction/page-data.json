So plain,<br>\nWhen another visitor intruded our gathering –<br>\nThe shabbily dressed Saddam Hussein[^21]!</p>\n<p>All my fantasy fiction friends,<br>\nLooked in awe at this non-fiction character,<br>\nBut alas! As they would realize later,<br>\nThey had forgotten the modern technology factor.</p>\n<p>Now, without caring to speak a word,<br>\nHe took out his favourite device,<br>\nAnd, with a simple flick of the arm,<br>\nThe bomb completed my heroes’ demise.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, though I hadn’t realized it then,<br>\nThe bomb had not affected me at all,<br>\nBut I was afraid to speak up,<br>\nIn front of Hussein so strong and tall.</p>\n<p>The terrorist then gave me a notebook,<br>\nRight after they had all been blasted away,<br>\nI took it, signed, and asked myself:<br>\n“What has fiction come to today?”</p>\n<p>[^1]: <strong>Carter and Sadie Kane</strong>: Involved with Egyptian mythology.
