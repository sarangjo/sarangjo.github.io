story.</p>\n<p>Anyway, one day, I took a walk<br>\nTo escape my hectic fame,<br>\nAnd, sitting down, thinking about quiet,<br>\nWaited patiently for the same.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, in the glen where I was seated,<br>\nI heard a whooshing sound,<br>\nAnd then an incident occurred,<br>\nThat left, on my mind, an impact profound.</p>\n<p>My heroes, Carter and Sadie Kane<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup><br>\nIntruded upon my premises –<br>\nFrom their facial expression<br>\nIt seemed they had left behind Horus and Isis<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>I seemingly looked handsome,<br>\nFor Sadie began to giggle and laugh,<br>\nCarter, giving her a stern look, said:<br>\n“Sir, I want your autograph.”</p>\n<p>Now my expression turned from excited to astonished,<br>\nWatching it must have been fun,<br>\nBut before I could get a single word through,<br>\nThere arrived on the spot – Percy Jackson<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>!</p>\n<p>Dressed in full Greek battle armour<br>\nWith his sword and shield at the ready,<br>\nReading his determined expression,<br>\nIt was hard to imagine him, in war, unsteady.</p>\n<p>Now he said, “Oh foolish Kane siblings,<br>\nI have Annabeth<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> by my side.”<br>\nAs if by magic, there she appeared and said:<br>\n“We’ll kill you with my knife and his Riptide<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup>!”</p>\n<p>Just as Sadie opened her mouth,<br>\nOn the demigods, some insult to confer,<br>\nSome more visitors descended from the skies<br>\nSaphira<sup id=\"fnref-7\"><a href=\"#fn-7\" class=\"footnote-ref\">7</a></sup>, Eragon<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup>, and his sword Brisingr<sup id=\"fnref-8\"><a href=\"#fn-8\" class=\"footnote-ref\">8</a></sup>!<br>\nEragon was clad in complete Alagaesia<sup id=\"fnref-9\"><a href=\"#fn-9\" class=\"footnote-ref\">9</a></sup> outfit,<br>\nBrisingr glistened in the mini-parade,<br>\nSaphira was looking as ferocious as ever,<br>\nLooking at them, it was hard not to feel afraid.</p>\n<p>Eragon seemed to be frustrated,<br>\nAnd said: “Your aspirations are all amiss.<br>\nThe autograph will only be mine,<br>\nI will blast you with the teachings of Oromis<sup id=\"fnref-10\"><a href=\"#fn-10\" class=\"footnote-ref\">10</a></sup>!”</p>\n<p>I was stunned by these amazing heroes<br>\nAmong the Dobermans, I felt like a cocker spaniel,<br>\nBut somehow, I felt there was someone missing,<br>\nSure enough – now came Bartimaeus<sup id=\"fnref-12\"><a href=\"#fn-12\" class=\"footnote-ref\">12</a></sup> and Nathaniel<sup id=\"fnref-11\"><a href=\"#fn-11\" class=\"footnote-ref\">11</a></sup>!</p>\n<p>Nathaniel, rather John Mandrake,<br>\nWas in a suit that looked rather funny,<br>\nAnd Bartimaeus, the wily djinn he was,<br>\nPresented himself in the form of Ptolemy<sup id=\"fnref-13\"><a href=\"#fn-13\" class=\"footnote-ref\">13</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The magician of amazing punctuality<br>\nHad drawn for Bartimaeus a pentacle<sup id=\"fnref-14\"><a href=\"#fn-14\" class=\"footnote-ref\">14</a></sup>,<br>\nAnd said with unfaltering superiority:<br>\n“I’ll turn you all to pickle!”</p>\n<p>Bartimaeus sniggered quietly<br>\nBut didn’t dare make a noise,<br>\nAnd I think the others were quiet because<br>\nThey tried to maintain a ‘laugh-less’ poise.</p>\n<p>It looked to me as if Eragon,<br>\nHaving had enough of the crazy boy,<br>\nWas about to cast a deadly magic;<br>\nBut couldn’t start his ploy:<br>\nFor now the newest guest arrival<br>\nWas the mastermind Artemis Fowl<sup id=\"fnref-15\"><a href=\"#fn-15\" class=\"footnote-ref\">15</a></sup>,<br>\nThen, as he noticed the crowd gathered for me,<br>\nHis smirk turned into a growl.</p>\n<p>Artemis was the only one,<br>\nWho spoke for Mandrake, a retort:<br>\n“It will be me who gets the autograph first –<br>\nFor who can beat my mastermind and Holly Short<sup id=\"fnref-16\"><a href=\"#fn-16\" class=\"footnote-ref\">16</a></sup>?”</p>\n<p>The answer for this rhetoric,<br>\nCould have been Annabeth Chase,<br>\nBut there Apparated<sup id=\"fnref-18\"><a href=\"#fn-18\" class=\"footnote-ref\">18</a></sup> Harry Potter<sup id=\"fnref-17\"><a href=\"#fn-17\" class=\"footnote-ref\">17</a></sup>,<br>\nCalmly, he replied to Fowl’s phrase:</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be so confident,<br>\nYou and the fairy are no match for me,<br>\nNow that I have defeated Voldemort<sup id=\"fnref-20\"><a href=\"#fn-20\" class=\"footnote-ref\">20</a></sup>,<br>\nNo one can stop me and Ginny<sup id=\"fnref-19\"><a href=\"#fn-19\" class=\"footnote-ref\">19</a></sup>!”</p>\n<p>As if in response to his loving call,<br>\nGinny Weasley appeared on the scene,<br>\nBut the contest for my overly famous autograph,<br>\nNow made her a jealous teen.</p>\n<p>For everyone, this was the last straw –<br>\nThe rising tempers were oh! So plain,<br>\nWhen another visitor intruded our gathering –<br>\nThe shabbily dressed Saddam Hussein<sup id=\"fnref-21\"><a href=\"#fn-21\" class=\"footnote-ref\">21</a></sup>!</p>\n<p>All my fantasy fiction friends,<br>\nLooked in awe at this non-fiction character,<br>\nBut alas! As they would realize later,<br>\nThey had forgotten the modern technology factor.</p>\n<p>Now, without caring to speak a word,<br>\nHe took out his favourite device,<br>\nAnd, with a simple flick of the arm,<br>\nThe bomb completed my heroes’ demise.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, though I hadn’t realized it then,<br>\nThe bomb had not affected me at all,<br>\nBut I was afraid to speak up,<br>\nIn front of Hussein so strong and tall.</p>\n<p>The terrorist then gave me a notebook,<br>\nRight after they had all been blasted away,<br>\nI took it, signed, and asked myself:<br>\n“What has fiction come to today?”</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\"><strong>Carter and Sadie Kane</strong>: Involved with Egyptian mythology.
