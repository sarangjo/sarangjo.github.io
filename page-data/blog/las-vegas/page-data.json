We packed up and waited for the arrival of Sanjay kaka. We loaded our baggage into the Range Rover and climbed on. We arrived in due time and did the needful at the airport. To our surprise, the flight was already boarding. We hurriedly got into the line and handed over our tickets to the attendant who processed them and allowed us to pass. I was looking forward to sitting in the plane because we had booked First Class Tickets. The area around the seats was very spacious and I sat with Sanika. I played Nintendo DS™ for some time, and then we played Rush Hour. I also read Agatha Christie. We reached Las Vegas airport at around 11:30 p.m. We picked up our baggage and waited in the taxi line. The line was almost never-ending and finally after about 20 minutes, we found a taxi for ourselves and rode to our 4-star hotel, Monte Carlo. At 12:10, we checked in and rushed to our room, 30-126, and fell into a deep sleep. The next morning we got a wake up call from a family we were going to meet: the Bhargava family. We got ready and headed down to the hotel food court where we saw them. Their names were Sandeep Uncle, Dimple Aunty, Rohan, and Sonal. They had already taken their breakfast and we introduced each other. Then we got our breakfast (mine was scrambled eggs and pancakes from McDonald’s) and sat down to devour it all. We got to know each other better, though Sanika was a bit cranky. We then went to the Bellagio, where there was a beautiful ceiling and a marvelous indoor garden and an amazing chocolate fountain. We all had ice cream and then went back outside to have lunch. While we were going outside, we noticed musical fountain which were put up by the Bellagio staff. It was so beautiful and it swayed to and fro. We looked around for a good Indian place to eat. We headed to a place called Planet Hollywood and inquired about an Indian restaurant. The said there was one after the Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Showroom. As we exited the place, my dad noticed a gigantic crystal sphere on the ceiling. After I looked more intently, I noticed that it was made up of hundreds of suspended crystals. Then, near the entrance doors, we found a wall consisting of “Welcome” in many languages. I scanned it for the Marathi version and found what I was looking. It said, “Swagat Aahe”. As we walked, I could tell that poor Rohan was feeling downright exhausted. So I tried to cheer him up, which surely did work. As we walked past the Motorcycle Showroom, we saw a huge motorcycle crashing out of the showroom. Finally, we saw the place, called “Tamba”. We had a stomach-filling lunch and then headed to Monte Carlo. There, the adults played a gambling game and the kids played Zooreka®. After that, there was a big jumble-up on who would play what. Rohan and Sanika were not ready to co-operate, though Sonal and I were ready to play together. Because of the toddlers, we couldn’t play anything. Then, we went to the M.C. Food Court and ordered our snack. After that, at around 6:30, we went to the Lance Burton Theatre for the Lance Burton Magic Show. It was spectacular and the amazing thing was that I was called on stage and was the day’s volunteer!!!! First Mr. Burton extracted coins from my nose, mouth, ears, armpits, sleeves, and more. Then, he said, “Thanks for co-operating so well. As a present, I’ll give you my very own Corvett car!!” He told me to sit in the car, and then told me to wave and smile. Then suddenly there was a bang and the car, Mr. Burton, and I disappeared! Then a nice lady called Karen called me and took me out of the car. We walked into the prop room, and she asked me my name and spelling to put on the screen. Then we went through a door which exited in the middle row. Then suddenly, the narrator told everybody to look at the chandelier. The chandelier began to descend and on the chandelier was Lance Burton!! Then he took my hand and led me to the stage where I bowed and then returned to my seat. After the show, we went to the Lance Burton Magic Shop and bought magic items. We went to the Food Court again and had dinner. At the court, people were shooting glances at me. I was famous!!  After dinner, we went to the Bellagio Musical Water Fountain Show. It was just amazing!!! I was flabbergasted by the precision of the synchronization of the music and water fountain. We saw to shows and then headed back to Monte Carlo. There I told them the disappearing trick which was done on the car. I wanted to play some more, but I was also tired and went to sleep. The next morning, Sunday, we went for breakfast with the Bhargavas. We then went up to the hotel room for some time to get ready, and then got into the Dodge™ Explorer® car and went to Hoover Dam and the artificially made Lake Mead. It was stupendous and the Hoover Dam was gigantic. We saw a video on how it was built and then we left Hoover Dam. It took us around half an hour to get back to Monte Carlo and upon reaching, we had lunch and relaxed. We played together and in the evening, the adults went to the casino. We played Zooreka and DS again, and then we went to Treasure Island for dinner. I had an episode of static shock and Rohan joked around by constantly poking at me. Then we went for Mystére by Cirque Du Soleil. It was just fantastic. The way the artists performed was just amazing. On the way back, that was all we talked about. Then, upon reaching Monte Carlo, we visited the Bhargavas, took some last-minute pictures, and then said bye-bye to them. We slept and the next morning, they were gone. We-Baba, Sanika, and me- went to the wave pool and had a lot of fun. Then we went upstairs got ready and went into the lobby to wait for my dad’s friend called Nilesh Kaka. We met him and went to his house. There we met his wife too. He gave me Harry Potter despite the disapproval of my parents. We went to the Venitian and had fun there. I ate a burrito. After that we went to the airport and the marvelous trip to Las Vegas was over!!</p>","fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"6 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Trip to Las Vegas","date":"September 01, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/las-vegas/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/new-dimension/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A New Dimension"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1732276557","3128451518"],"slicesMap":{}}
