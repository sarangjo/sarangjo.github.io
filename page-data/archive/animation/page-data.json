Mostly games, cartoons, and videos. But in reality, animation is a highly advanced concept, regarding the motion of (seemingly) inanimate objects.</p>\n<p>The first animation was a “crude” one. It was involved with the usage of a flip-book. On each page of the book was a character in one pose, changing minutely with every page. So, when the flipbook is flipped, the character apparently “moves” from one pose to the other, giving the impression of motion of the character. This is the basis for the advanced animation which we see all around us today. The only difference is that instead of a flipbook, we have a binary matrix; and instead of our hand flipping the book, we have a superfast computer shuffling through the images and light-speed. This is even more effective (obviously) because of two reasons. One is that the images which are stored are copies of the previous, only modified subtly. The other is that the speed gives an even smoother experience. This concept of composing a smooth moving image from many different “frames” is based on a scientific principle.</p>\n<p>Our eyes have a property called the persistence of vision. In accordance with this, our eyes take 1/24th of a second to capture an image on the retina and send it to the brain where it is processed. This means that in a second, our eyes can send 24 images to the brain. Now, if two images are sent to the eye within 1/24th of a second, the second image is like a delay and when the brain processes it, it is like a smooth moving object. This is an extremely powerful concept, which is put to full use in animation.</p>\n<p>Animation is useful in two ways:</p>\n<p>First, it is an amazing source of entertainment for more than 50% of the world’s population. It gives an outstanding feeling of actually being in that virtual world – not only video, but also interactive gaming has been taken to higher and higher levels with newer and more advanced animation technologies.</p>\n<p>Second, it is a great tool for teaching and introducing programming to children (or college students, for that matter). The attractiveness and addicting nature of animation is a very fun way to teach the excellent concept of programming. The fun nature of animation is an excellent incentive for students to enthusiastically take part and experiment new vistas of learning.</p>\n<p>Today, there are many animation software applications present – Alice and Scratch to name two elementary applications. They have made using and working on animation very easy-to-understand and user-friendly, so as to make more and more people aware of this great tool.</p>\n<p>So animation is an awesome concept of today’s world. It can be used in many ways, as I showed above. I hope that I have been able to drive through the great use and implementations of this wonderful tool.</p>","fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Animation","date":"October 15, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/archive/animation/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/balance/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Key is Balance"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/sound-belief/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Sound Belief"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1732276557","3128451518"]}
