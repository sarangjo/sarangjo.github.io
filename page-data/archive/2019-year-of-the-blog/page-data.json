My dad always pushed me when I was in middle school to just write about anything — and write about anything I did, with a strong emphasis on “anything.” Looking at my “Creative Works” folder on OneDrive, I marvel at the amazing range of uninteresting topics I managed to spew some bland words about. I wasn’t a very imaginative child, to say the least, but I suppose I tried my best at the time.</p>\n<p>Now, a few (many) years later, my imagination hasn’t improved at all, but the amount of free time on my hands definitely has. And so I’m trying for the umpteenth time to get (back? No, too generous) into a regular habit of just writing. In particular, I want to try to post something on this blog once every two weeks. Sounds underwhelming, I know, but considering that my life is an endless series of writer’s block phases (at what point is something not a phase but a lifestyle?) that already sounds pretty daunting. I’ll also throw on the whole “new year, new habits” nonsense as a reason for this, even though that really is just coincidental timing.</p>\n<p>One important disclaimer that I want to make clear to my legions of avid readers, though, is the tagline of this blog: “Because OC is overrated.” (OC = Original Content) Almost every blog that I enjoy reading offers insights into hot-button topics plaguing today’s society, scathingly hilarious reviews and commentary of popular culture, or just such phenomenally beautiful writing that the content doesn’t even really matter.</p>\n<p>My blog is going to have none of that.</p>\n<p>My plan is to projectile-vomit whatever’s on my mind when I sit down in front of my laptop, and following as cursory a review as possible, SMASH that “Post” button.</p>\n<p>So please enjoy this likely failing attempt of mine to maintain some semblance of creativity in a time where a cynic would say it’s in critically short supply but a realist would say it’s in the same supply as always. Peace.</p>","fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"2019 - Year of the Blog?","date":"January 02, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/archive/2019-year-of-the-blog/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/54-minute-adventure/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My 54-minute Adventure"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1732276557","3128451518"]}
