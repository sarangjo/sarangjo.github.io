All four of us look at the one screen that matters, the tension in the air only exacerbated by the lack of sound. The mouse hovers over “Launch Java Application” for only a mere moment before my friend’s finger comes crashing down upon the poor mouse button. Everyone’s eyes move to his phone, those few seconds of launch to the phone feeling like ages. The screen turns black, and we all hold our breaths. But only seconds later, the black message-box of doom pops open: “Unfortunately, LightRunner has stopped working.” And just like that, the suspense breaks, with the irritated sighs of four tired, sleep-deprived, stressed high school students. We trudge the long walk of shame back to our laptops, just as the next song starts playing, ironically, “We are the Champions.”</p>\n<p>It’s merely days until Demo Day, until salvation, until we could prove our worth in front of GeekWire Magazine and countless other co-creators. Failure after failure had continued hitting us, and as “unfortunate” as it was, a game that had been made just as a fun idea for a group project was still unfinished. Queen’s masterpiece song is greeted by silence, and the looks on everyone’s faces reflect the mood in the room: we are closer than ever to giving up. I aimlessly scroll through the code we had so tediously written, only half-heartedly looking for a potential bug in the code. I feel the waves of disappointment and helplessness coming from my comrades-in-arms, as distractions like Facebook and anything but code invade their screens. How can we hope to compare to other developers who had created so much more than a ridiculously simple mobile game? What was the point of staying up so late and stressing out so much if it was only going to fail time and time again? But in that moment of despair, I have a moment of awakening. That little part of my mind that spoke so rarely in times of helplessness loosed its rhetoric on the rest of my gloomy thoughts. The point of staying up so late, you asked? The point of failing time and time again? The point of making all those memories with friends, setting in stone those few moments of glory, so few and far in between? The more important question to ask is, what’s the point of setting and aspiring to such high goals if it isn’t difficult along the way? It’s the challenges of drawing 5 different prototypes on paper for an angling system before hard-coding the algorithm, the difficulty of handling 10 different objects in one method – and, most importantly, the unmatched toil of persevering through imminent failure that make a project really worthwhile. Without those challenges, there’s no reason for that victory at the end of the tunnel. There’s more to an endeavor like that than just being able to say you’ve finished if you didn’t have to put any effort into it – or even worse, being able to say that you gave up because it was too difficult. What makes me most proud of LightRunner and the work my friends and I did with it isn’t the fact that it’s advanced, well-made, or addicting – because it is definitely none of those things. What makes me proud of that 2000-line “marvel” is the fact that in the face of so many troubles and problems in the way, I was able to stick with it till the end, and watch it reach its fruition.</p>","fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Picotech","date":"December 03, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/archive/picotech/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/54-minute-adventure/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My 54-minute Adventure"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/inspiration/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Inspiration, A Digression-Ridden Reflection"}}}},
