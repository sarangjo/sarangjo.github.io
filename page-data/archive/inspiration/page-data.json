It is something that provides impetus not only for day-to-day activities (like me blogging) but also for world-changing events (like me blogging) (just kidding) (but seriously). People find inspiration from a variety of sources, all of which are an important part of their lives. Some find it in objects: say the beautiful moon in the night sky, or perhaps a particularly stunning 24-carat gold-studded vintage 1947 Berlin Staedtler periwinkle graphite color pencil that they found lying unclaimed on a wet rain-soaked street. Others might draw motivation from certain events that take place in their lives: possibly a beautiful sunrise that they witnessed as they stood atop an atoll or some such natural feature and basked in the glory of Nature in her full splendor.</p>\n<p>As I have made clear, these sources of inspiration (SOI’s, I like to call them) are both numerous and varied. Yet each person has his/her own specific, unique seed of stimulus (I refer to it as an SOS – wait, never mind, that one’s already used). And, as a result, many people find others’ causes for encouragement (COE’s – better) to be somewhat odd, or even – if I may be so bold as to use such a scandalous word – outright stupid. While this may sound like an extreme view of my fellow human beings, if you’ll think about it, I’m sure some of you will empathize with me when I say that I cannot understand how someone can draw inspiration from a color pencil. Drawing pictures with a pencil, I understand, but drawing inspiration? I fail to comprehend. But I am confident that some bloke out there must have found aforesaid pencil in a moment of reckoning and now cherishes it with his life and creates inspired sketches and portraits of the purest genius. He, on the other hand, would find it mind-boggling that someone could be so transparently bizarre as to be inspired by an actual human being. He might think, “Is this human a pencil? Is this human gold-studded? Most important of all, is this human Vintage 1947 Berlin? Then how is it inspiring in any way?”</p>\n<p>My responses to these questions are, sadly, “No.”, “No.”, and “No.” This special person that I am inspired by is not, I am ashamed to admit, not a pencil. She isn’t gold-studded, unless you count the jewelry that adorns her perennially, and she is definitely not Vintage 1947 Berlin: more like Modern 1995 Pune. And she is, the one and only, the first search result if you search her name on Google, Aboli Joshi.</p>\n<p>On days when I have nothing to do – and such days are few and far between, what with high school and all – I wonder about what I should do. Maybe play the Xbox? Or perhaps watch some video on YouTube? But writing – creative writing – is never one of the first things that come to mind. That isn’t something I can choose to do. If I want to play Xbox, I can switch the thing on, put on some headphones, and play for two to three hours on end. If I want to watch a video, I can – the only thing in my way is Internet, which isn’t that much of an obstacle. In fact, most of what I would do to pass my time is entirely a process of “Want!” to “Do!”</p>\n<p>But the desire to put my thoughts down in ink – or pixels, nowadays – differs from any other of my time-passing activities in that inspiration is required before this desire to allow any stray disconnected thoughts to manifest themselves in a somewhat cohesive manner is fulfilled. My inspiration for my creative writing is almost all the time the work, thoughts, and actions of the very same Aboli Joshi.</p>\n<p>Aboli has been producing works of pure genius since her time in the internationally acclaimed educational institution, Saraswati Education Society’s Gurukul High School. My first experience of her work was one in the school annual, which published students’ creative work: “On the Write Track” (a pretty clever pun about the fact that the original Gurukul classrooms were housed in old railway carriages… get it? Write Track? Right Track? Track? Railway track? Oh well.) It was, I believe, a small paragraph about one of her experiences. It was short, concise, and rather badly written – because, well, she was in sixth grade. It made me laugh nevertheless. Well, more from its simplicity and scoff-worthiness than from its actual humor, but … I did laugh, and that’s all that counts. From then on out, there was no looking back.</p>\n<p>In ninth grade, I decided to start taking the bus, because, heck, why not? It just so happened that that annoying, short, loud, bespectacled, bossy prefect who no one listened to was on the same bus as I was. To keep up my reputation of making sure every girl in the school hated me, I tried talking to her so as to piss her off. Turns out she was better at it than I was, much better, and she effortlessly kept up her reputation of being irritating and annoying.</p>\n<p>Now I know I’m being mean here, but just wait for a bit and I’ll get to the good stuff.</p>\n<p>After the first week or two, it wasn’t so bad, and we could all have a cohesive conversation – and by conversation I mean Aboli saying 4-5 sentences and one of the rest of us slipping in maybe a sentence, most often just a word or two. And then it would be followed up by another 15 minutes or so of Aboliness (“Aboliness.” Noun: The quality of speaking rapidly without paying attention to other people’s responses.) It was quite amusing for a large portion of the year, because the topics we “talked” about were so random and unrelated to anything that listening to Aboli’s spin-offs was often the highlight of my day. And, for the first time ever, I actually askedto take the bus instead of going by car.</p>\n<p>In 9th grade, our fates entwined once more… Okay, that sounds weird. What I mean is that we ran into each other again and were forced to put aside our MANY differences and work together. For that year, it was the 9th and 10th grades’ job to create a script for the annual concert. For some reason, both she and I were on the writers’ board. As was the norm, Aboli took – or should I say stole – the reins of the writing process, and she spearheaded the effort to make it interesting and funny: thus came the idea of a spoof of the Ramayana and the Trojan War. I was a bit taken aback at her writing skills, to be honest. I mean, irritating, sure. Annoying, sure. Intolerable, sure. But good at writing? This was unprecedented. But I rolled with it and spouted script of the purest genius while she floundered around looking for some good content. (I’m just kidding, I didn’t contribute anything to the process at all) When we were finished, the entire script looked great, and Aboli’s contribution made it the perfect send-off for their batch.</p>\n<p>There on out, there was no looking back. We overcame the initial disgust that we had for eachother (I got cooties shots that year, I believe), and a great friendship was born. Sadly, just as this great partnership in crime was about to bloom, I moved to the US, leaving her in tears. Regardless of the distance between us, I firmly hold true to my belief that Aboli, since I’ve gotten to know her amazing, unparalleled genius, has inspired me in more ways than I can write down.</p>\n<p>Her writing is some of the most beautiful, poetic, and metaphoric I have ever witnessed. Aside from their eloquence and elegance, what she writes has an amazing second layer of meaning that is so relatable and believable that it blows my mind away every time. From her innocuous but cute poem about History, back in 2008, to her moving response to the horrendous Delhi gang rape crime, Aboli’s writing inspires me to write my own again and again. Every time I see an update on Facebook, or on my Blogger, I instantly read what she’s written, marvel at her genius, and then get an idea for a possible piece of prose or poetry.</p>\n<p>While inspiration may come in various forms, mine has come from that one bubbly, annoying, condescending, loud, bespectacled girl. She never ceases to amaze me. I feel unquestionably honored and lucky beyond words to have a friend such as her. And while another might wish she was a 24-carat gold-studded Vintage 1947 Berlin Staedtler periwinkle graphite color pencil, I guess I can live with what she is right now.</p>","fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"8 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Inspiration, A Digression-Ridden Reflection","date":"February 05, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/archive/inspiration/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/picotech/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Picotech"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/balance/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Key is Balance"}}}},
