And, to handle the team, there is a Captain. Co-ordinating the players, setting the field, deciding who will play – these are just some of the endless jobs on his list. The performance of the team reflects how well he handles it.</p>\n<p>I feel that the best captain in modern cricket was Mahendra Singh Dhoni, in the initial few months of his captaincy. A bright youngster at the time, Dhoni had showed promise, with a few 50+ knocks. As a test, the Board put him up as the captain, to see how his leadership was. And yet, he led the Indian team to success. Time and time again, he not only captained well, but played his game well – wicketkeeper as well as batsman.</p>\n<p>If you watch his games, when India is fielding, you will notice Dhoni always cheering his team, helping them play well. Patiently, he directs the fielders, never getting angry himself. He exhibits all the good qualities of a leader – good leadership, calmness, and a great presence of mind.</p>\n<p>Now, I hope that this will help him lead India to a World Cup!
