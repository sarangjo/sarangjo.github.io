Some people say grandparents are cranky
They also say they are boring.
Me? I do not; not in the least!
I find them so adoring.

"Why am I saying all this?" you'll ask,
Well, this is why I say:
I love you so, so much!
With you, I always feel so gay.

You love me, you care for me,
You've taught me so much I didn't know
You also adore me; and I assure you,
I donâ€™t know many who have looked after me so.

I feel you are like a second mother,
Though an awesome grandma is who you are.
I fully know that you will guide me,
No matter how near or far.

But this poem is specially for you,
For crossing a majestic milestone.
For spending years of helping othes,
I acknowledge you and you alone.

As a concluding statement,
I would finally like to say,
Just two words for my dear Aji:
"Happy Birthday, Aji! Happy Birthday!"
