I found this from my old folders. I wrote this in eighth grade. A work of pure genius, of course.

Enjoy.

P.S.: I still can't believe I wrote this.\
P.P.S.: Oh wait.... No, never mind, I definitely wrote it.

Hello. What's your name??? Mine is "Hello". Pretty weird, huh? Well, if someone comes to me and says: "Hello Hello!" then an innocent bystander might wonder, "I think that guy has a extremely short term memory loss. He just said hello, then why's he repeating it?"

(One more thing is that those of you avid readers are viewing this on Microsoft Word might see a squiggly red line below the second "Hello". I feel sad to say that it is also an innocent bystander {I know it doesn’t stand, but what the heck} because when I right-click on the second "Hello" it says, "Delete Repeated Word". Jeez, I tell you!!)

Well, I'm happy to say that there aren't too many innocent bystanders in this peaceful world. And, this thingy (I haven’t yet decided what to call it: story, novel, line, sentence, word, character, whatever) will eliminate those innocent bystanders in those who are reading this thingy (don’t make me go through that again!).

Well, just to add the icing, my name isn't Hello.

Oh jeez I forgot about the icing (I'm a diabetic).\

It is 12:00 am. It is absolutely quiet (well, not really, but for the thingy's {please refer story 1} sake, I got to call it that). An owl hoots. "Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!" it says. Sorry about that, I'm not too good at onomatopoeia (if you don't know what it means … … …

I'm sorry I don’t have that much time). So. Back to the point. The owl has just hooted. Remember? Good. Then… the rustle of the leaves mingles with the eerie howling of the night dogs. "Aaaaaaoooooooooooo!!" They howl. Same reason again. Ok, sorry. A fleeting shadow catches the eye of the wakened child. He watches as a gleaming ball appears 4 feet above the ground, with a brilliant black slit halfway. The child trembles in its scanty blankets. Sorry about the inappropriate usage of adjectives. Well, actually, adjectives are the parts of speech which… all right, just kidding, don't worry, I'm not teaching English here. I would have loved to (I'm looking to the stars {it's night} with sadness in my eyes), but I can only get my bucks through this worrisome profession. Which is telling pointless stories. That's why this story has no end. Well, actually it does, but it's completely beside the whole point (I'm not your Geometry teacher either, don’t run away).

There isn't any icing here, but a delicious cake is in front of me at this moment. Mhhhhhh aaaah. I can smell it … I reach toward it and … my colleague bends over, picks it up, and gobbles it up in one bite. (Is that a mouth or what!?)\
I really wanted that icing.\
or in other words\
At least he could have kept the icing.

_Scene: On the road_
A boy comes from the east. A girl comes from the west. They meet.\
"Hello," he says.\
"Hello," she says.\
"Good afternoon," he says.\
"Huh?" she says.\
"It's the afternoon, isn't it?" he says.\
"So?" she says.\
"Oh, never mind," he says.\
"Good," she says.\
"What!" he says.\
"I said 'good'," she says.\
"Why?" he says.\
"I am the queen of my mind am I not?" she says.\
"So?" he says.\
"Oh, never mind," she says.\
"Good," he says.\
"What?" she says.\
"Oh, don't start that again!" he says.\
"Okay," she says.\
"Thanks," he says.\
A pause.\
"Look!" she says.\
"Where?" he says.\
"There!" she says.\
"Where?" he says.\
"There!" she says.\
"Where?" he says.\
"Oh, jeez you missed it," she says.\
"What?" he says.\
"That thingy," she says.\
"What thingy?" he says.\
"That thingy that just went by," she says.\
"Huh?" he says.\
"Oh, never mind," she says.\
"Oh, please, tell me what it is," he says.\
"No, I don't think so," she says.\
"Aw, please!" he says.\
"No, I feel irritated by you," she says.\
"Why?" he says.\
"Oh, forget it. Good day," she says.\
And leaves in a huff.\
"Eh?" he says.\
"Was it something I said?" he says\
"Oh never mind," he says.\
And leaves in a huff.

Actually, I don't understand why I ever wrote this. Oh, whatever.

**By the Great and Generous and Narrative Hello**

I had to add the 6th and 7th words, otherwise how would I write such a meaningful narration?

Here, sadly, there is no icing. Man, I wish I wasn't a diabetic. Well, there isn't anything here, because I just finished my breakfast and the table is cleared. Darn!

One day, as I was relaxing in my private limousine, my exquisite and strong chauffer turned around, and pressed a button to open the automatic sliding window. This window is a prize accessory of mine. The button is located near the hydraulic activator of the hand brake. When it is pressed, the circuit is closed, and the OR and AND gates switch on and off, to transport the electric signal through the brown Copper wires.

Now, these wires are of high quality too. They are generated by completely automated machines of the highest quality. They have in-built gyro sensors to monitor the shape and movement of the raw material, i.e the copper, the iron, and the plastic.

This plastic is of amazing quality, as it is created by the first plastic company, Bakelite. It consists of a tri-quad-penta-polymer, consisting of 5729 synthetic structures of Carbon-12 and Hydrogen-2. Cool, eh?

So….

Uh….

Where was I?

Ugh, never mind.

**By the Great and Generous and Forgetful Hello**

Well, I have to be frank in front of my ever-supportive fans! (cheers in the crowd) Yes, yes, thank you. Well, I have to admit I'm a bit forgetful. As you can see, I was about to eat the icing, as I forgot that I am diabetic.
