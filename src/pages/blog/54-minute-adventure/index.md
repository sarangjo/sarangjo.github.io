Around 2 or so months ago, I received an innocuous 5x5 inch informational postcard in the mail. Like Harry Potter in the first book, I was instantly enraptured. The word "scholarship" jumped out at me, and I read through it. It read January 15, 2014, and so I added it to my random pile of random college informational mail, where it lay and collected dust.

Fast-forward to January 15, 2014, at 11:03PM. I'm cleaning my desk, and that fateful postcard falls off the table. I pick it up, read the date, and my mind goes into 6th gear. I look at the clock, right as it ticks from 11:03 to 11:04PM. The night was yet young.

I sat down, cracked my knuckles, turned on my Bollywood playlist, and started the application. There were a few hitches along the way, for sure, like 3 essays to write, but it was only another stalk of wheat in front of my unstoppable thresher.

11:58PM, I uploaded the last gosh darned PDF file, made sure that my name was right, and hit that Submit button.

And so, my friends, I started and submitted a college-related application in 54 minutes. My reward? A bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios, and homework from two nights ago to catch up on.

Life goes on.
