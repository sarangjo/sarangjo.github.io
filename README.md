Personal website based on the Gatsby starter blog.

## Branches

- `deploy` - the deployed website
- `main` - production-ready "dev" branch
- all other branches are working branches

## Setup

1. Head into `./plugins/gatsby-transformer-fountain-local` and run:
   ```
   $ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
   since we're using a local version of `gatsby-transformer-fountain`.

2. Then, move to the top-level directory and run:
   ```
   $ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
3. Run
   ```
   $ npm start
   ```
