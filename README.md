Personal website based on the Gatsby starter blog.

## Branches

- `deploy` - the deployed website

- all other branches are working branches

## Setup

1. Head into `./plugins/gatsby-transformer-fountain` and run:
   ```
   $ npm install

   since we're using a local version of `gatsby-transformer-fountain`.

2. Then, move to the top-level directory and run:

   $ npm install
   ```
3. Run
   ```
   $ npm start
