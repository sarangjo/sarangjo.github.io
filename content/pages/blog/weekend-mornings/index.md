title: Weekend Mornings

_TL;DR: Good thinking. Nothing of use in the intro, skip to [the main part](#the-main-part) if you're actually here to read interesting content._

Anyone who knows me relatively well will know that I pretty much am the definition of "night owl". This conversation I had recently sums it up nicely:

> Them: "So do you like waking up early in general?"
> Me: "Yeah, you know, I'm kind of an early worm..."

Exactly. It doesn't really make sense: if I were the early worm, I'd get eaten by the early bird.

As a result of staying up late, early mornings are a thing of mystery to me. Sure, through high school I had to wake up at ungodly hours on the weekdays, but I usually didn't wake up fully until period 3. In college, after a disastrous fall quarter freshman year where I had an 8.30AM class a 25 minute walk from my dorm, I vowed never to take a class before 10.30AM if I could manage it, and I certainly was able to, save a few annoying exceptions.

All this to say, I don't like waking up early.

And when it comes to **weekend** mornings, those are pretty much nonexistent, because while there's a good reason to be up in the mornings on weekdays, there usually isn't any on Saturday or Sunday. Yet for some unspeakable reason, certain weekend mornings stand out in my memory like tall skyscrapers built by real estate magnates amidst a sea of slums. Perhaps it is precisely their otherworldly nature that gives them that importance, or perhaps it's a subconscious message from my brain telling me to wake up earlier. Either way, I thought it might be nice to firmly cement these memories, and even give them more meat by way of trying to remember everything that happened.

Enjoy!
