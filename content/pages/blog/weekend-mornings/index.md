title: Weekend Mornings

_TL;DR: Good thinking. Nothing of use in the intro, skip to [the main part](#the-main-part) if you're actually here to read interesting content._

Anyone who knows me relatively well will know that I pretty much am the definition of "night owl". This conversation I had recently sums it up nicely:

> Them: "So do you like waking up early in general?"
> Me: "Yeah, you know, I'm kind of an early worm..."

Exactly. It doesn't really make sense: if I were the early worm, I'd get eaten by the early bird.

As a result of staying up late, early mornings are a thing of mystery to me. Sure, through high school I had to wake up at ungodly hours on the weekdays, but I usually didn't wake up fully until period 3. In college, after a disastrous fall quarter freshman year where I had an 8.30AM class a 25 minute walk from my dorm, I vowed never to take a class before 10.30AM if I could manage it, and I certainly was able to, save a few annoying exceptions.

All this to say, I don't like waking up early.

And when it comes to **weekend** mornings, those are pretty much nonexistent, because while there's a good reason to be up in the mornings on weekdays, there usually isn't any on Saturday or Sunday. Yet for some unspeakable reason, certain weekend mornings stand out in my memory like tall skyscrapers built by real estate magnates amidst a sea of slums. Perhaps it is precisely their otherworldly nature that gives them that importance, or perhaps it's a subconscious message from my brain telling me to wake up earlier. Either way, I thought it might be nice to firmly cement these memories, and even give them more meat by way of trying to remember everything that happened.

Enjoy!

## The Main Part

TODO make sure everything is first person present tense

1. Cartoons in the morning

TODO fix and make first-person

(c. 1st/2nd grade) I don't really have too many concrete memories from this time, understandably. What I do remember is mainly assisted by the home videos that my parents took of me and my sister back then. Watching those videos seems to awaken something fuzzy deep in the recesses of my murky memory, but really it's just me telling myself that the video I'm watching was in fact something that happened to me.

2. Summer trip from India to the USA

I wake up naturally, without an alarm (either electronic or human). For a few seconds I'm not sure where I am, but then the unexpectedly fluffy comforter makes clear that I'm in the US, more specifically at Atya's ("Atya" = aunt) house. I get up and out of bed, and glance at my phone - it's 7AM. Jetlag at work. I hear the occasional bird chirping, and the lack of sounds is almost oppressive. I'm listening for the absurd music that plays when cars are reversing, the casual cross-society shouted conversation, and the constant buzz that means people are around &mdash; but all I hear is the occasional hybrid driving by without a sound. After a few moments realigning my internal GPS, I go to the bathroom and get fresh. I walk downstairs slowly. The house is quiet, since I know Atya likes to sleep in a bit on the weekends. The blinds are down, but the sun is bright enough to bathe the living room in a soft orange glow. I grab a bowl Honey Nut CheeriosÂ© (good thing Atya had it ready) and moodily eat at the dining table, not really thinking about anything.

For those few moments, it feels like I'm the only one awake in the world, and the rest of the world is still in a slumber.

3. High school "morning"

I groggily open my eyes as my mom knocks on my bedroom door. I make sure it is my mom, because if it's my sister I'm going to me mad. I roughly make out what she's saying: "It's 11:30, we need to be at a lunch by 12!" I groan internally, fully aware that "waking up late" wouldn't really count for our family friends as an excuse for being late at a lunch scheduled for noon. For the 2000th time, I regret staying up beyond 3am the previous night for no reason whatsoever. While I did get just around 8 hours of sleep, it sure as hell doesn't feel like it, considering that I'd slept for less than 5 every day the preceding week. I'm grumpy, I'm tired, I'm hungry, I feel gross. I sit up and check my messages on my Nokia Lumia 700, when there's another knocking on the door. This time it is my sister, and before she can say three words, I shout "Uthloy mi!" (I'm already up!) Unwarranted and unnecessary, sure, but I was annoyed. More at myself than her, to be honest, but there you have it. It takes 20 minutes for me to get ready, my already slow pace slowed down further by my lack of interest in this lunch.

If only I could sleep till 2pm and play video games all day.

4. Trip to Swedish with Kavya

shift started at 6.30

I'm rudely awakened by the death-knell of the default Android alarm clock. I turn over, waiting for Kavya to turn off the alarm. 5 seconds pass, then 10... Every "beep beep beep beep" (you know how it sounds) is like a knife in my heart, making it skip a beat like the end of the world is upon us. I turn back over, squinting with one eye, to realize Kavya woke up a while ago and is finishing getting ready. I fumble with her phone, just about managing to turn off the alarm within another 10 seconds. As I turn back over, slowly being whisked away by sleep, the sweetest of temptresses, a somewhat less sweet temptress calls "Sarang! Get up, we need to leave in 2 minutes!" I can't really ignore that, now can I. 7 minutes later, with the clock showing a lovely 5.50AM, garbed in a barely passable-in-public outfit, we leave Stevens, on our way to Swedish Hospital Cherry Hill for Kavya's morning shift for the Prep Step program. Why the woman wanted be pursue the infernal occupation of being a doctor was beyond me. I suppose it was my job to be supportive and help out where I could, though, and she needed a ride, so there I am. All of this is running through my head as I get into my trusty Acura next to my apartment in Stevens. As we drive off, the conversation actually picks up, and the tiredness slowly fades away. At one point "Marhaba" from _Malli Malli Idi Rani Roju_ starts playing, and we get lost in trying to sing along with it. The end result of the drive, however, is that I was much less salty about being up at such an ungodly hour, and dawn had truly broken.

We pull into the Swedish Hospital's parking lot, looking for a spot up on the 4th floor. I have brought my laptop to do some work, but I'm not quite sure where I would be able to work, so I walk with Kavya to the main hospital building. As any last vestiges of sleepiness I may have had depart with speed, thanks to the brisk Seattle morning air, we realize it's 6.25, so we have to rush so Kavya doesn't miss her 6.30 shift. She leaves me awkwardly standing in the middle of the relatively empty lobby, and I'm glance around for a spot of some kind to take refuge on. I spot a comfortable-looking cushioned seat in the lobby, decked out with full back support (i.e. it's right up against the wall). I settle down, and pull out my laptop because I need to start the latest CSE 331 project that's due early the following week.

For the first few minutes I'm just getting situated, having only just properly woken up. Then I think of the last song Kavya and I listened to right before we parked, and I realize that that's exactly what I'm missing. So I open up Saavn, find the song, and get it rolling. Ek Pal Ka Jeena, from Kaho Na... Pyaar Hai. About 2 minutes in, it hits me that this song might just be the single greatest song to ever be written and performed by mankind, and I turn on the "repeat 1 song" option. Now, I'm in the zone.

The next 2-3 hours fly by. I am possessed by a frenzy
