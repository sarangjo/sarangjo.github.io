Anyone who knows me relatively well will know that I pretty much am the definition of "night owl". This conversation I had with someone I recently met sums it up nicely:

Them: "So do you like waking up early in general?"
Me: "Yeah, you know, I'm kind of an early worm..."

Exactly. It doesn't really make sense, and I'd get eaten by the early bird.

Anyway, while I have a chronic disorder

1. Cartoons in the morning
2. Summer trip from India to the USA
3. High school "morning"
4. Trip to Swedish with Kavya
5. Awaaz Competition
6. Today
