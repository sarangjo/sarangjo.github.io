> A meandering stream of consciousness about memories, remembering things and not remembering them, with some real memories sprinkled in.

# Intro

For as long as I can remember, I've had bad memory.[^1] But every so often, I'm gripped by a soul-deep anxiety that I've begun to forget so many important things, people, memories, and places from my life. It's paralyzing, knowing that I've lived a whopping $26.75 \times 365$ days on this Earth and yet struggle to remember the last one. Who am I, what is my identity, if not the sum of my lived experiences? If I can't even point to those experiences and say, "I was there. I did that. I lived that," then... what has it all been about? Even without the existential questioning, it's also pretty annoying day-to-day, forgetting the basic things I shouldn't be. It makes people think I don't care about them. People say you'll always remember the things you care about... But I care about so much and remember so little. Why?

# Immediate response

In true 21st century 20-something fashion, I've chosen to cope with the **symptoms** rather than try to address the root of the problem first. The solution is simple: obsessively try to hold onto anything and everything I can that will help me remember as much of my past as I can. I have box upon box of truly the most random items through the years - a faded train ticket from a visit to the DC area, a math notebook from 5th ~~grade~~ standard where I scored 100% on every quiz for a 5-month stretch, my first Stargram[^2] from a high school theater production: the list goes on and on. Going digital has certainly enabled my hoarding, further spurred on by my obsession for organizing and categorizing things in general. Paradoxically, I can't remember the last time I actually cracked those crates open and checked out those compulsively collected curios &mdash; in my head there's some undefined point of time in the future when I'll sit back and turn back the time. Hoard now, reminisce later: that's the mantra.

Of course, I'm not a perfect hoarder; while the gaps in the artifacts of my life history may be intermittent, they sure stick out like a sore thumb. I lost all of my photos from a year and a half of college: I had only saved all of them to my laptop, and one day my laptop just stopped working abruptly. Poof. Gone. More recently, I forgot to back up all of my online documents that I'd saved to my UW Google Drive account during undergrad, before the account expired and the Google I trusted so dearly swallowed all of them whole. Hardest to swallow was the loss of all of the sheet music I'd worked on with UW Awaaz. And I'm sure there are loads of precious memories that I **could** have held onto with some associated item, but didn't.

# Remembering via music

I guess if I'm being fair to my hippocampus[^3], I do remember some important things of my own accord. Sometimes things come back to me totally randomly, brought on by a random phrase someone said, or driving on a road I might have driven on before. But my favorite "memory trigger" of all is music. So many songs that I listen to are a veritable Pensieve memory, taking me back to the time and place in my life that I associate with that song. I love chasing those threads down and boring whoever's around me with the story every time I hear a song that's in this special echelon. I've even resorted to organizing my Spotify playlists by the 6-month interval in which I discovered the song, because the songs I listen to invariably end up putting me right back wherever I was in life at the time. A favorite song-memory that I always go back to is this sort of half-formed memory from when I was maybe 6 or 7 years old. It was late, and my dad and I were waiting at the erstwhile[^4] Sammamish regional library for my sister's daycare to finish. All I remember is me sitting by the window, my face pressed up against the glass, watching the nighttime traffic on 228th go by. And the song that triggers this memory? "Sacrifice" by Elton John.

As for why that memory is tied to this particular song? I have no idea. Maybe it was playing in the library at the time, or maybe my dad played it in the car on the way to/from the library? Whatever it is, that song always puts me right back in that spot at age 6 (or 7). I could go on and on with many more songs (See: "Weekend Mornings", 2016 memory), but I'll save that for an 8-hour road trip when people are stuck in the car and have no choice but to listen to me ramble.[^5]

# Memories <-> time

Now if I'm being honest, I know I am insufficient in a lot of ways [^6]... So why is it that losing memories specifically makes me scared unlike anything else? Why do memories hold such power? I guess at the core of it all, it's all about time. Every key I hit (especially Backspace, which I've probably hit the most during this post) takes away a smidge [^7] of my time away that I can never get back. And now that I've had some time to give voice to my existential crisis above, what I'm experiencing (perhaps more dramatically than everyone else, as I am wont to do) is the most human affliction of all: the passage of time. Time, the great equalizer, the great healer, the eternal, the one resource we all share, and we all lose in equal quantities no matter what we try. And boy oh boy is the corpus of human experience littered with treatises and poems and essays and eulogies about time. And, not so unpredictably, the thing that comes to my mind first when searching for the best example that speaks to me the strongest is music.

I present Exhbit A: _The Slow Rush_ by Tame Impala. This album definitively owned my 2020 music rotation [^7] by a wide margin. An absolute masterpiece from start to finish, this album (Tame Impala's fourth) was the first one released after I started actively following him thanks to &mdash; I kid you not &mdash; a Ford Edge commercial during a football game. [^8] The theme of this album, as I see it, is time. Every song examines a different aspect of how time &mdash; the past, the present, and the future &mdash; impact the human experience. Even the title, _The Slow Rush_, captures the duality of time. The ticking of time can be slow; just listen to the wall clock (if you still have one) at night when you're trying to sleep. The interval between each `tick` and `tock` lasts an eternity. And yet some days go by in a blink of the eye, more so now I'm older. Did they really happen, or did we Daylight savings a whole day instead of just an hour? Take the track "Borderline" for example: the theme in this song directly connects to the feeling I share of trying to grab onto something to slow the passage of time, but knowing only too well that my grip is tenuous at best:

> We're on the borderline / Caught between the tides of pain and rapture,
> Then I saw the time / Watched it speedin' by like a train / Like a train.

Hits me right in that vulnerable spot, every time.

# What about everyone else?

## Siddhesh

Funnily enough, after an incredible Tame Impala concert in 2021 in Washington, D.C., when my friend [Siddhesh](https://siddhesh.substack.com) and I got some food on the streets near Capital One Arena, it was this exact topic that we talked about. It had been a few years since we'd hung out, and just under 11 years since we had been at Gurukul together, and so much of it felt like a blur all these years later. Perhaps the concert had struck a chord in us (it was, of course, part of the _The Slow Rush_ tour), but our conversation quickly turned to reminiscing and bemoaning the fact that such an incredible and formative part of our life felt like something in our mental periphery that we could never truly and fully remember. That quote from _The Office (US)_ came to mind: "I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them." A few months later, I stumbled upon some audio recordings I had taken of a random day in 9th ~~grade~~ standard, self-assured that those low-fidelity, hard-to-understand snippets of audio would be sufficient to call future me back to that place and time easily. But now, they elicit mere flashes of memories of simpler times, and nothing more... and surely the more time passes the more we will forget.

--------------------------------------------------- GOOD TILL HERE ---------------------------------------------------

I could go on forever if I wanted to list all of the ways people have expressed their anger, fear, confusion, and more that is borne out of time. But one subsection of that compendium of grief that's particularly relevant and chock-full of examples has to do with memories.

What do memories mean in the grand scheme of things? Dementia is one of the most feared diseases in the world. Taking photos is so easy now. Movies and TV shows consistently jump on this - look at _Memento_. Memories are such a core part of the human experience that it's immensely difficult to live in the present at times.

# Do memories matter?

But as we sat there, downing cheap but delicious Chinese food, a previously unthinkable idea came to my mind. Maybe you're only supposed to live and feel those moments, well, in the moment. The richest of feelings comes from knowing you really were fully invested in something. Something about It's too easy now to try to prioritize taking photos over being present; but you have to try to find a good balance so it doesn't overtake being there in the first place.

In the panic of trying to take the best photo of a place I visit, I lose sight of the beauty of the fact that I am where I am in that moment. In recent trips, I've tried to make sure to just take 30 seconds to fully be present and immerse myself wherever I am.

Videos = sight + sound; memoirs/diary, 1 second a day, best thing from the day

# Looking forward/message/call to action?

I don't really know if anyone else feels this way, but if you do I hope this felt validating, knowing that there's someone else out there who hates the sieve-like nature of their brain too.

If I had to think of something to take away from this, just for you who do relate, I guess it's the age-old adage plastered on every artsy wall hanging: live every day to the fullest. Keep in touch with the people who have had even the smallest connection in your life - use social media for good for once. Make it a point to try to reach out to someone you haven't talked to in forever. It doesn't have to be an immensely deep conversation, it just feels nice to know they're still doing well and what a different sequence of steps have led them to where they are in life now. Do memory games, keep your brain active. Write. Put down in ink (or 1's and 0's) the things you worry about losing and you might find yourself holdong onto them even better than before.

[^1]: I guess that means that I _might_ have had good memory at some point... but I don't remember that, so I can't be sure.
[^2]: A stargram was a cute little "Congratulations on performing in this play!" to a member of the cast/crew that an audience member could pay for
[^3]: Is my brain me? Or is it a separate entity? But what is my identity without my brain thinking about that identity?
[^4]: [A fun little read](https://www.historylink.org/File/20301) told me that the library where this memory happened is not where the Sammamish library is located in the present day. Funnily enough, the old library was at 825 228th Ave **NE** while the current one is at 825 228th Ave **SE**.
[^5]: You, sadly, always have the option of closing this tab. I hope you don't though.
[^6]: Sorry, no, I'm not listing them all here. That's for another time.
[^7]: If you're curious, I type at ~600 CPM so each key would use up roughly 0.1s.
[^8]: So you can bet my easiest access point to 2020 memories are by listening to this album 🙂
[^9]: Check it out here if you don't believe me: https://youtu.be/aWNTCdpg7qo. The sample from "Let It Happen" starts at 0:11 and the part after 0:23 is maybe one of my favorite guitar solos of all time.
