# 1. Manali

The beginning of our trip,\
Began at the Pune Airport,\
We arrived at 5:30 a.m.,\
Though Prachi's health was out of sort.

We proceeded to the airplane,\
In the usual style,\
It was an uneventful flight,\
Though it was only for a little while.

Upon reaching Delhi,\
We got transferred to our next stop,\
The place was Chandigarh,\
I kind of thought the airport was a mini flop.

Then we took the 10-hour drive,\
To Manali, our first halt,\
The place of amazing beauty,\
In which no one can find a fault.

We reached the Mayflower at 10:30 p.m.,\
To have a late dinner,\
I thought, "Of all the hotels,\
This surely seems the winner!!"

# 2. Sojha

We traveled 109 kilometers,\
Hoping Sojha would be fun,\
And reached the Banjara Retreat,\
Under the setting sun.

The 7 of us were given two rooms,\
Chilgoja for the Mehtas; Chir for us,\
We left the luggage there,\
And proceeded to late lunch without fuss.

We had barbeque potato,\
And enjoyed the view,\
Then had some dinner,\
And rested our heads too.

Next day was active,\
We went for a waterfall walk,\
The forest was serene\
And the waterfall seemed to talk!

The way back was just as interesting,\
We arrived in time for the noon meal,\
The kids watched the Incredibles â„¢,\
The surroundings had a peaceful feel.

A bonfire was lit,\
We had paneer near the wood heap,\
Dinner was excellent as usual,\
And then we went to sleep.

The following morn,\
The place looked like a resort,\
The Joshi's went for the waterfall walk,\
While the Mehta's went to a fort.

The Joshi's returned early,\
And played on the carom board,\
Then the Mehta's came back,\
Feeling anything but bored.

During the afternoon,\
Sojha showed us its true form,\
The rain fell in torrents,\
And Nature cooked up a storm.

The evening was the same,\
The adults went for a stroll,\
The kids got social with the others,\
And the wet grass made many roll.

As the parents returned,\
We played standing kho-kho,\
Then went for dinner,\
And then slept low.

Next morning we had breakfast,\
The last we had over there,\
Then packed up and got ready,\
To leave at a time fair and square.

So ended our stay at Sojha,\
A memorable one by far,\
I won't forget it; will I?\
Next stop: Thanedar!!
