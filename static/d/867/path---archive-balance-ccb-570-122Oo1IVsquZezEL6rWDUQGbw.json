If you decide to mold your entire life only off of your social life, then any mishap - or, as you say, ‘detour in the opp. direction’ - will cause a major setback in my entire life. Balancing out priorities, or things we give importance to, always helps. Most teenage girls lay importance only on two things - social life, and school. Unconsciously, they assign overwhelming importance to one on their own, and an external force (homework, teachers, or exams, for example) stresses the importance of the other.</p>\n<p>The key to solving this problem is adding another factor in our life. You told me you play basketball, correct? There’s your third factor. Music could be another, or drawing. Or even composing a poem about how wonderful your friend is. Things like those help immensely in general. But you must remember to lay the correct amount of importance (and, consequentially, stress) on it. Being too carefree about something - breaking regular routine, not going to classes (if any) - isn’t help, and neither is getting too worked up about even the simplest of things. The key, as I see it, is balance.</p>","fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Key is Balance","date":"October 21, 2012"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/archive/balance/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/theater/laugh-for-posterity/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Laugh for Posterity"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/archive/inspiration/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Inspiration, A Digression-Ridden Reflection"}}}}
